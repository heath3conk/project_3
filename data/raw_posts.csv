"Why, during freezing weather, does only the water at the top of a bucket freeze/turn to ice?","I've seen a fair few videos over the last few days of people taking an inch or so of ice from the top of a bucket of water.

How do blood cells leave the bone marrow?,"In high school, I used to assume that the bone marrow was connected to the bloodstream in a simple way, and that all blood cells moved into the rest of the body by means of diffusion. But that is not the case. 

Apparently, finished blood cells have to ""squeeze"" through semi-permeable tissue before they're allowed to enter the veins. I doubt this is accomplished through simple stochastic processes alone. Unfortunately, it's been difficult trying to figure out how this looks at a granular level, and I don't know where to begin. 

I wanted to know more about how this is accomplished, if there are any key gateway proteins or other molecules responsible for the process, if this process looks substantially different for each kind of blood cell (e.g. RBCs, WBCs, platelets, etc.), etc. A brief rundown or series of pointers that can get me going on my own research would help enormously.

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15186wx/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

How to Model Unconventional Number Sequences Mathematically?,"Hello everyone,

I'm curious about how to handle number sequences that don't follow traditional linear patterns. For example, we all know a sequence like 2, 4, 6 can be easily described with a function like f(x) = 2*x. But what if we encounter a sequence that doesn't follow such a straightforward pattern? For instance, consider a sequence like 8, 3, 7, 1, -5, or any other seemingly random set of numbers.

My questions are:

1. How can we accurately describe these unconventional sequences using a mathematical formula?
2. Is there a method to predict future values in such sequences, assuming they follow some underlying but non-obvious pattern?

I'm interested in any mathematical or statistical models that could be applied to this problem. Any insights or references to relevant theories and techniques would be greatly appreciated!

Could your red be my blue?,"I feel like this question gets asked quite often, but I haven't seen any responses that would satisfy my.

Can we be cartain that everyone sees colors the same way? I'm not talking about colorblindness.

People usually reply with ,,we can't know"", or ,,there are slight diffrences"", but I want to know if we can reasonably assume that someone's blue might be another person's red.

I know it's technically possible, because we can't really check color interpretation differences between people, but this doesn't seem right to me. 

Could our brains really perceive colors so differently? I mean if you look at the color spectrum, blue and red are far apart. How would our brains come to such different results? Wouldn't everything have to be swapped around? 

The wavelength of red is around 700nm and the wavelength of blue is around 500nm. If some people saw red as blue, why would their brain jump from orange to blue without any colors in between?

Another thing is, wouldn't that result in a lot of people having color blindness? Chances of having colorblindness are quite low, especially if you have XX chromosomes.

AskScience AMA Series: We are NIMH Director Dr. Joshua Gordon and NIMH Deputy Director Dr. Shelli Avenevoli. We are leading the federal agency charged with setting and supporting the national agenda for mental health research. Ask us anything!,"Hi reddit! We are leading the federal agency charged with setting and supporting the national agenda for mental health research and are excited to talk with you today.

[Joshua A. Gordon, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director) is the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). He oversees an extensive research portfolio of basic and clinical research that seeks to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. Dr. Gordon pursued a combined M.D.-Ph.D. degree at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Medical school coursework in psychiatry and neuroscience convinced him that the greatest need, and greatest promise, for biomedical science was in these areas. Dr. Gordon's research focuses on the analysis of neural activity in mice carrying mutations of relevance to psychiatric disease. His lab studied genetic models of these diseases from an integrative neuroscience perspective, focused on understanding how a given disease mutation leads to a behavioral phenotype across multiple levels of analysis. To this end, he employs a range of systems neuroscience techniques, including in vivo imaging, anesthetized and awake behavioral recordings, and optogenetics, which is the use of light to control neural activity. His research has direct relevance to schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and depression. [Follow Dr. Gordon on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/NIMHDirector).



[Shelli Avenevoli, Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/about-nimh-deputy-director-shelli-avenevoli-phd), is the Deputy Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). In 2001, Dr. Avenevoli joined the NIMH intramural research program as a staff scientist in the Section of Developmental Genetic Epidemiology of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. In 2005, she moved to the NIMH division of extramural research as Chief of the Emotion, Mood, and Depressive Disorders Program. In 2008, Dr. Avenevoli became Chief of the Developmental Trajectories of Mental Disorders Branch. She has been heavily involved in a number of key NIMH efforts, including revising NIMH's Strategic Plan, re-defining the Institute's approach to supporting research in neurodevelopment and bipolar disorder, and serving as a liaison to other agencies for special initiatives. Prior to joining NIMH, Dr. Avenevoli received her Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from Temple University, and completed an NIMH-funded postdoctoral fellowship in psychiatric epidemiology at Yale University School of Medicine.

We'll be available starting at 11:00 am ET (16 UT), ask us anything!

How does the mass converted to energy work in nuclear explosions?,"So I know that basically the amount of mass “converted into energy” in a nuclear explosion is multiplied by the speed of light squared to calculate the energy in joules from E=mc^2.

Have humans unintentionally created habitats for new species / lifeforms?,"I was watching some urban exploration stuff on YouTube wasting time when it occurred to me how much infrastructure there is in place for humanity that's gone unmaintained for sometimes whole centuries.

I know that there's been talk of creating a designed bacteria to breakdown and digest plastic for use in environmental contexts, but is there any scientific backing to the notion that mankind has already accidentally created bacteria that flourishes breaking down metal alloys or potentially biohazardous waste that's not naturally occurring?

"AskScience AMA Series: I'm a sleep expert on a Washington Post podcast where I give tips on how to sleep better, explain how worrying about not falling asleep can make things worse, and more.

Looking forward to answering any questions you might have for a longtime practitioner. I love my work and have learned pretty much everything I know from my patients. What really matters is what works for someone in all their individuality.

I started in this field in the 1990s knowing nothing about sleep other than how good it felt and how many psychotherapy patients struggled with it. My boss at the time generously offered me the life-changing job-which I didn't know existed--while we were kibbitzing in the hallway. He might as well have casually suggested that I teach a course on comparative vertebrate morphology. But I learned on the job, and learned through parenting both the toll sleep loss takes and its survivability.  I have increasingly come to appreciate how the disciplines of sleep therapy and psychotherapy inform each other. My practice and the field have evolved a lot since the days of same-old, same-old behavioral advice.

"What Does Iron Do In The Human Body, and How?","Hello folks,

I've got a question about iron in human biology. I know that it's used for lots of things, but I don't really know what it actually does: I know it's present in blood, and I read something about a protein called ferritin that's present in most cells, but I have no idea *how* it assists with blood or what ferritin *does*. And I'm sure iron does other things in the body that I don't know about!

So, I've got three questions:

1. What things does iron do in the body, and how does it do them?
2. What is it about iron that makes it able to do these things? Could another kind of metal do the same thing, or does it *have* to be iron? Maybe another kind of ferromagnetic metal?
3. Does iron interact, or is it involved, with DNA at all? Or no?

I'd appreciate it, too, if you could explain this in as simple terms as possible, because I am not at all a biologist or physician. Thank you!",askscience,1704592615.0,t3_190gni4,post

Do newer vaccines 'displace' older ones?,"Hello,  
  
I recently had a flu vaccine and was wondering about the effect on older ones.  
  
From the very limited amount that I understand, the body creates antibodies and memory cells in response to a vaccine, which helps your body fight the disease in future.  
  
However there is presumably a finite number of possible antibodies and memory cells in a body. As such, does having a new vaccine dilute the effect of previous ones to any significant degree?

As an example, if someone takes a flu vaccine every year for forty years, would this be expected to have an effect on reducing defenses against illnesses they were vaccinated against when a child?

How much time per day did/do hunter/gatherers spend on survival?,"I’m sure it depends on their location/climate. Maybe it’s best to focus on comfortable climates. 

I was watching someone on TikTok make the point that Ted Kazinski said in his manifesto that he wanted humans to return to the time before technology started booming because early humans were focused solely on survival and he liked that for some reason.

It all got me thinking, how hard was it out there for early man?

I’m talking pre agriculture Homo sapiens. Part of me agrees and thinks it was hard for my ancient brothers and sisters and that existence would be a constant toggle between fight and flight. But another part of me thinks, wait a minute. Those dudes pretty much had all of my cognitive ability. They just lacked my technology and cultural knowledge. Maybe these guys are smart enough to get food fast and then chill for the rest of the day.

Isn’t that what our technology comes from - leisure time? Maybe these mother fuckers had it in droves. 

To be clear, I’m not saying Ted Kazinsky was on to something. The process of getting back to those days is a non-starter. 

I’m just wondering if there was a golden age of kicking it for thousands of years rolling out of bed and spending 2 hours per day hunting and gathering and then doing an hour or so of chores and shit and then the rest of the day is yours.

how does viral load matter for infection with different viruses?,"Before COVID I didn't really have any concept of ""viral load"", I thought that getting infected with a virus was a very binary thing - you get exposed to the virus and you're sick, or you don't get exposed and you aren't.

Now I understand that *how much* of the virus you get exposed to can determine how sick you get. If I got drenched in the face by a sneeze from someone with a high COVID load (funny story: my first COVID infection, I believe, began with a sneeze in the face from my infected 2yo son), I would get a lot sicker than if I my exposure had been much lighter.

Is it this way for all viruses?

Like, with HIV, would I get sicker much faster and progress to AIDS much sooner, if my initial exposure was to a much larger amount of virus?

tldr; question is, do all viral infections vary in intensity according to the magnitude of the exposure? Or are some more ""binary""? 

Bonus question:
Is there some concept of ""critical viral load"", like, if I get a single HIV viron in my bloodstream, there's a chance it will never find a host and the infection will never happen (right?). But if there are 1000, infection is a certainty (right?). So there's a 'critical value' somewhere in-between (right?). How does this vary for different viruses - are some more *virulent* than others?

How Do Gravitational Waves Affect A Human Body?,"Hello, folks!

I have two quick questions about gravitational waves. Let me say up top, I realize that there's not much we know about them, so I'm perfectly satisfied with 'best guess' answers here. Obviously if there *is* a known correct answer, that's best, but if not, an answer that seems to logically make sense given what we *do* know will work fine!

Now, for the questions!

1. Do gravitational waves diminish over time? Or, rather, do the distortions they cause diminish over time (and space)? Do they start to fade like a ripple in a pond, or do they maintain their level of distorting spacetime as they expand?
2. What is your best guess for how a strong gravitational wave might affect a human body? Would it just kinda pass through a person without being noticed, since it's distorting spacetime and the person is inside spacetime? Or would you feel it, kinda like a pressure wave? Would its effects likely be more macro or micro in scope? What would be your best guess as to how this would affect a human body - or, what might you compare it to? Any medical conditions you might compare it to?

Again, I realize that there's probably very little information to go on, so if we have to resort to conjecture, I'm comfortable with that, but I'd like to base our conjecture on as reasonable information and/or assumptions as possible.

There is a prominent theory that legumes/pulses (like peas, lentils, chickpeas) impact food absorption or body mechanisms in a way that causes diet-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) aka enlargening of the heart chamber in dogs and maybe cats (this started from widespread reports to the FDA about grain-free diets and non-genetic DCM cases which led to the FDA issuing an alert and investigation into this issue).

Apparently in the pet food industry, only less than a handful of brands are ever vet-recommended mainly because their ingredients and the interactions of those ingredients in those forms have been researched front and back on safety. Namely corn. 

So apparently, when mixed with meat products, corn is harmless, but legumes might be causing severe heart problems. Why is that? I know there isn't enough research on this specifically, but in a broader sense and theoretical aspect, how can food combinations do this?",askscience,1704059552.0,t3_18vi25q,post

Can dogs sense magnetic fields?,"Sorry this question is a bit weird. We have a border collie who has so far chewed:

1. A wire on an automatic gate
2. A wire on a pump/water feature
3. The brakes wire on our caravan

But here’s the odd thing. She isn’t much of a chewer, and she stops chewing the wire after it’s disconnected. The pump wire has been severed months ago. The wires are still hanging, if they were fun to play with before, they’re still fun to play with now. Only difference is now there’s no current flowing, so no magnetic field. And she stopped chewing it.

Idk if this helps but I think all of the wires she bit were DC (connected to battery for the van and solar for the gate and pump). So a static magnetic field, same as Earth’s field, although sharks, for example, can still use it to navigate.

All of the sources online are a bit sus, but there’s a lot that claim that dogs can detect magnetic fields, so I was wondering if anyone here had thoughts on whether my dog can detect magnetic fields or if it was just a coincidence.",askscience,1704000633.0,t3_18v0g1y,post

Why is it especially hard to figure out the causes for autoimmune diseases and how they work?,"I recently got ""diagnosed"" with ""some sort of arthritis"" (they are still figuring things out) and in general have been dealing with random symptoms throughout my life, which has led me to read up on several autoimmune diseases throughout the years.

We have either no idea why they happen (and in some cases not even the mechanism behind the symptoms). Or at most, a host of theories and maybe some knowledge about (potentially) involved genes (but even then, only theories, if at all, as to what actually triggers the onset).

Why is it such a struggle to figure out how autoimmune diseases work?

How saline were the earth's oceans during the Last Glacial Maximum?,"[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water#/media/File:Water_salinity_diagram.png) sea water is 34.7 parts per thousand salt.

Between evaporation and precipitation it seems like this amount is kept largely in equilibrium but, during the last glacial maximum, a lot of this precipitation would have frozen to form glaciers. 

Since that precipitation didn't make it into the ocean it stands to reason that this would have increased the salinity of the oceans. And sure, if the amount of water held in the glaciers was a drop in the bucket compared to the water in the oceans then I guess it wouldn't have made much of a difference.

But, [according to USGS][3]: ""global sea level was about 125 meters below today’s sea level at the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago"".

AskScience AMA Series: Upcycling Agricultural Sidestreams - We are researchers here to discuss our latest analysis on upcycling agricultural leftovers to produce edible alternative proteins. Ask Us Anything!,"Hello r/AskScience!

Joining us are Lucas Eastham, M.S., Priera Panescu, Ph.D., and Bryan Quoc Le, Ph.D., who are here to answer all your questions about upcycling agricultural ""leftovers"" for the production of alternative proteins.

**Upcycling sidestreams is a critical step toward creating circular bioeconomies that produce food more efficiently, affordably, and sustainably.** The [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/) (GFI), a nonprofit think tank working to make the global food system better for the planet, people, and animals, recently released a new report, ""[Cultivating alternative proteins from commodity crop sidestreams](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/)."" Find the GFI Sidestreams analysis report [here](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/) and webinar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5HMeQzRU34).

The report identifies sidestreams (""leftovers"") that have tremendous potential to maximize food production via alternative proteins, while also reducing the costs and environmental impacts of agricultural waste. Specifically, this analysis identifies the optimal sidestreams candidates from North America's top crops that could be valorized for (1) protein concentrates for plant-based food ingredients, (2) protein hydrolysates for fermentation or cultivated meat media, and (3) lignocellulosic sugars for fermentation media.

This analysis highlights the major challenges associated with bringing these sidestreams into commercial use for the food industry. It also outlines strategic geographic opportunity areas and the need for public-private partnerships to fully exploit the economic and environmental potential sidestreams offer. Ultimately, the report aims to provide a landscape and actionable insights that commercial, non-profit, and public sector stakeholders can use to direct their efforts in building a sustainable, circular bioeconomy in the food industry.

[Lucas Eastham](https://gfi.org/team/lucas-eastham/) (/u/lucase-GFI) is a Senior Fermentation Scientist at The Good Food Institute, and previously worked for 10 years in microbial biotechnology bioprocess development for biofuels, biofertilizers, food ingredients, and cosmetic ingredients.

[Dr. Priera Panescu](https://gfi.org/team/priera-panescu/) (/u/Chemical_Preaction) is a Lead Scientist at The Good Food Institute. She is focused on analyzing plant-based meat and proteins, and how to expedite their progress. Prior to GFI, she spent nearly a decade working on polymer, formulation, and materials chemistry research.

"Could a system exist such that the vibration of its molecules due to heat, spontaneously synchronize?","So spontaneous synchronization is the idea that multiple oscillators that are physically connected in some way, can spontaneously synchronize their oscillations. 

My question is, is it possible to construct some system such that the random vibrations of molecules due to their thermal energy could spontaneously synchronize?  Could macroscopic movement arise from these microscopic thermal vibrations?

It feels like what I'm suggesting would violate the second law of thermodynamics,  but im not entirely sure about that.  As spontaneous synchronization of any oscillators also feels like it'd violate this law yet it obviously is real.

Perhaps it is possible, but only for sufficiently small systems?  I recall from a statistical mechanics class i took years ago that certain weird phenomena were actually possible for sufficiently small systems (such as a decrease in entropy for a small collection of particles, as the more orderly microstates were far more likely simply due to the number of permutations being much smaller)

Do longer trains always take longer to stop?,"I was thinking about how trains stop, the engineer pulls a lever which releases air from the brakes, which makes the wheels slow down.

Intuitively longer trains take longer to stop because they have a lot more momentum, but obviously they also have more wheels and brakes. I'm guessing that a 100 car train will have the same ""brake to weight"" ratio as a 10 car train.

I read that the delay between the lever being pulled and the air being released toward the back of the train contribute to the braking distance. Before the last car even starts braking the train has already moved forward. 

But in a perfect system where all of the brakes are applied at the same time, would a train with 100 cars take longer to stop than one with 10 cars? Assuming each individual car has the same mass and braking force. After all if you had 100 semi trucks driving on a motorway and had them brake at the same time, they'd stop within the same distance as a single semi would.

"How does a ""battery box"" work to help electret microphones?","Some background and then details on my specific case:

When people record live music, there's typically a few things they carry in their kit: 1) a microphone (in some cases a pair of electret mics), 2) a ""battery box"" which provides power to the mics and passes the signal through to a 3) recording device.  Most recording devices also have their own ""mic level"" power, but ""tapers"" highly recommend using a battery box and turning off the power from the recorder if possible.

&#x200B;

My questions are: what does a battery box do and is it really important in my setup described below?  Is there anything I can do to improve my design, like using different resistors - i.e., would 3-6K resistors (or even lower) be better?

In my case, I'm making my own ""battery box"" using info available online.  It basically has [this](https://i.imgur.com/SUswVO6.jpg) layout.  I am using a 12v (21/23) battery and 9.1K resistors, along with capacitors of sizes ranging from 22pF to 1uF (I've built several on the premise that the 22pF caps help provide bass roll-off, while the 1uF do not).  I kinda understand the purpose of the caps (at least in theory), but it's the resistors that I'm confused about, and ultimately how important the battery box is in this setup.

When measuring the inherent ""mic level"" output of my recorder (a Roland R-07), I see 2v and what looks like \~0.015ma.  This would directly feed the mics in the absence of a battery box.

With the battery box (12v battery + 9.1K resistors), I see 12v and \~0.10ma.

The electret mics I'm using typically have 2.2K impedance, require 1-10V, and use ~0.5mA max current.  A schematic of one set of mics I'm using is found [here](https://i.imgur.com/aibNo3C.jpg).  I've tried some prototypes of both the mics and the battery box out, and the recordings sound fine when recording volumes loud enough to require ear plugs - no clipping or anything, but I wonder what the resistors are doing and if the 9.1K ones I've chosen are the best for this application.

E: corrected some values.

How do atomic/molecular orbitals absorb light at EXACT frequencies?,"I'm a junior chemistry major but I still haven't really had this explained.

The curve in an absorbance spectra, as opposed a straight line at an exact frequency, can be explained by the doppler effect. If light is absorbed in an orbital at X frequency and you shoot light with a frequency of 0.95 X at the orbital, if the molecule is moving towards the light source at a certain speed, the doppler effect will increase the effective frequency to X from the perspective. Works similarly if you shoot light with a frequency of 1.05 X and the molecule is moving away.

There's uncertainty in every measurement. When you measure a liter of water, you can say a liter, or be more precise, say 1.0 liters, and then 1.02 liters, 1.018 liters, etc. You can always get more and more precise. How do we deal with precision in the energy difference between electron configurations? The frequency of light needed to excite an electron configuration from the ground state to an excited state is in a molecule is often given in eV. If there's a difference of 3.21 eV between two configurations, and the light hitting the orbital has an energy of 3.21 eV, the orbital will absorb the energy and become excited. What if the difference between the configurations was really 3.214 eV, and it was hit by light with an energy of 3.213 eV? Would it still be absorbed?

"Does heat keeps traveling, or does it disappears after a while?","Hello everyone. I was thinking about that question for some time and I think that it keeps traveling but I can be wrong. Let me explain what I mean: lets suppost that in a cold day you put the heater on and you open the window. The heat escapes through the window. The temp outside is 32°F / 0°C and inside is 80°F / 26°C. If you measure the air temperature (assuming that the winds are calm) outside close to the window, the temp is about 50°F / 10°C. As you go further and further, the temperature approaches 32F/0C. But, in a microscopic level, I was thinking if that heat keeps ""alive"" and ""travels"", then in a really miniscule difference, say for example 32.0006°F / 0.0003°C (assuming that outside is exactly 32.0000000 / 0.0000000°C).

Could lions survive Sub-Zero winters in the wild?,"Lions, obviously, come from the savannah, so they adapted to live in the heat, and not so much the cold.

What is the Earth's primary source of energy?,"My wife and I had a debate. My wife said sun and I said geothermal (core and mantle). I would agree with the sun if the question was phrased ""primary source on the surface of the earth""
Earth core is hotter than the surface of the sun. Sunrays hitting roughly half the earth from a distance away would not generate as much power than the core? I know the core's energy is mostly inacessible to humans, but the question does not ask whether it's acessible or not? I don't know if I'm missing something.

AskScience AMA Series: Meat Without The Animals: The science and future of cell-cultivated 'lab-grown' meat. Ask us anything!,"Demand for protein - especially meat, which takes by far the biggest toll on the environment - is soaring as the population grows, tastes change, and incomes fluctuate. As people around the world gather together for food-rich holidays, we wonder: **Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet?**

One possible solution is something you've probably seen in the news and around your social feeds recently: [cell-cultivated (aka 'lab-grown) chicken](https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/lab-grown-cultivated-meat/index.html), beef or even seafood. Do you think it could be part of future sustainable Thanksgiving meals?

Meat cultivated from cells - that doesn't require raising and killing animals - is starting to show up in a few restaurants in Singapore and the U.S. A recent poll from [The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research](https://apnews.com/article/can-meatless-mondays-help-environment-b09eaab6cbdce176debff415b48b1ec0) found that half of adults in the meat-hungry U.S. would be unlikely to try it. A majority of those who said they wouldn't said ""it just sounds weird."" As part of a new series from AP, I explored whether cultivated meat, which some people call 'lab-grown' meat, could ever displace animal agriculture. And, as a vegetarian myself, I looked at what it would take to tempt consumers to try it.

Join [me](https://apnews.com/author/laura-ungar) (Laura Ungar), journalist [JoNel Aleccia](https://apnews.com/article/labgrown-chicken-cultivated-meat-863e7d68c8c4a5293683a7c5d6a58d15) - who covered the FDA approval for sales of cell-cultivated chicken in the U.S.- and [Claire Bomkamp](https://gfi.org/team/claire-bomkamp-ph-d/) - who is a lead scientist focused on cultivated meat and seafood at The Good Food Institute - at **2pm ET (19 UT)** for a conversation about the future of meat without animals.

Is there any way to know how extinct animals with no fossil remains looked?,"After looking it up, I found out it is estimated that we do not have the remains of most, probably 99%, of the animals that existed a very long time ago in the past/prehistory, because fossilization is rare, meaning most animals do not fossilize but instead rot away or are destroyed by natural phenomena or disappear another way. On top of this, we have not dug very deep into most areas of the Earth, so we likely do not even have the remains of most animals which did fossilize.

But is there any way we could possibly figure out or guess how such creatures looked?

Pretty much what it says on the tin: Is it possible for a reindeer to never grow antlers in its life? If so, why?  
Like, are there any genetic illnesses that might hinder antler growth? Any diseases they can catch that might attack the systems that make antlers grow or something? I'd expect any hypothetical lack of antlers to be due to Something Going Wrong because they seem pretty important, but is it at all possible for it to just be a rare genetic quirk or something?  
How badly might any of these hypothetical causes affect the animal? Could it live a mostly-normal life? Would it be sickly and weak? Would it just die in infancy or the womb? Something else?

Would a car accelerate faster with more gravity?,"Hello I'm looking to settle an argument I've recently had with my buddies (who are all engineers) about the physics of a hypothetical race car in different gravitational environments. My hypothesis is that a car with all other factors the same including air density on a level plane will accelerate faster in slightly higher G environments than in slightly lower G environments. This hypothesis assumes that traction is a limiting factor of acceleration for this vehicle.

My reason for this hypothesis is that in higher G environments weight and therefore traction would increase but mass would remain unchanged. This would prevent the vehicle from spinning it's wheels off the line resulting in faster acceleration times than a lower G vehicle and since mass is unchanged it would have negligible impact on horizontal acceleration. They argue that since the vehicle would have more weight (not mass) it would be substantially slower.

Bloomberg did an investigative documentary on cancer-linked ""forever chemicals."" Ask us anything.","Hi Reddit! This is Tiffany from Bloomberg and I am joined by Dr. Philippe Grandjean of Southern Denmark University here. In a new documentary, I interviewed Dr. Grandjean on how substances known as PFAS, or ""forever chemicals,"" found their way to every corner of the planet-and the consequences.

You can watch it here: https://youtu.be/t8qGtEVh7oQ?si=QNjv4-IorQrCtpL4

PFAS are used in hundreds of everyday products-from fabric protectors, electronics and non-stick pans to foams, tapes and even toilet paper. PFAS are called ""forever chemicals"" because the properties that make them so useful to consumers make them very persistent in the environment.

In the Bloomberg Originals video documentary The Poison In Us All, we reveal how the chemicals - which have been linked to cancer and are the subject of sweeping litigation - ended up inside the bodies of almost everyone on the planet.

Litigation has revealed documents showing that its manufacturers, including industrial giant 3M, had dumped the chemicals for years and have been aware of the dangers associated with PFAS. 3M has said its products ""are safe and effective for their intended uses"" and assailed plaintiffs' lawyers for selectively citing documents to portray ""an incomplete and misleading story about 3M's actions.""

Is the blood drawn from a living person different from the blood drawn from a recently deceased?,"Hi all!

This may be a silly question, but I am interested in learning if a forensic scientist will be able to tell if a vial of blood is drawn from a living person or a person who has recently died. 

Imagine a room with a living person and someone who has recently died (a little over 1 hour), and a forensic scientist arrives blindfolded (with all the testing equipment he may need). If I draw blood from either the living person or the recently deceased and give it to the scientist, will he be able to tell where the blood came from based on the ""freshness""?

Thank you in advance.

Why did agriculture first appear in regions of Middle Latitudes?,"There is a general consensus that agriculture started in Fertile Crescent around 12 thousand years ago, later independently in other regions around ""middle latitudes"" such as China and Mesoamerica. People usually focus on the timing but my question is why it started roughly in middle latitudes? 

Today most fertile lands (mollisols) are located in Canada and Eurasian prairies but as far as we know, these are not where Neolithic Revolution first took place. Was there more important factors for progenitors of first domesticated plants, such as growing season suitability, population density, paleolithic tools etc., or when Holocene started, these middle latitude regions had mollisols already but later lost their fertility? 

I assume complex interplay of different factors are offered by different scholars without a consensus but any answer or suggestion for academic publication is welcome.

Why isn't the bottom of the ocean hotter?,"So there's a train of thought here and I'm sorry if I ramble, but I'm not sure how to actually explain what I want to know very well or I'd just Google it myself.

So I've been watching deep sea documentary videos. And they say Challenger Deep is 12000 meters down and almost freezing. But the furthest down we've been able to drill is 11000 meters, and as far as I understand it, the heat was the biggest obstacle preventing going further. Plus unless I'm just misunderstanding everything, shouldn't higher pressures increase temperature? 

So how is the deepest depths not hotter than a couple degrees? My first thought was the hot water would rise and cooler water would come down to take it's place, but that would cause like constant sideways tornadoes of water. So I searched if vertical currents were a thing. I found upwellings and downwellings. But most of what I could find was related to shallower water nearer the coast.

AskScience AMA Series: We're producers of the PBS/BBC miniseries Spy in the Ocean. We created more than 30 animatronic spy creatures to dive deep in the ocean and record sea creature behaviour. Ask us anything!,"Hi everyone! We are the producers of the documentary miniseries [*Spy in the Ocean*](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/collections/spy-in-the-ocean/). For this installment we created more than 30 realistic animatronic spy creatures to explore the seas and capture never-before-seen animal behavior. The Spies we created include a whale calf (our biggest yet!), shark, dolphin, manatee, cuttlefish, octopus, seal, crab and many more. Utilizing the latest subsea technology, these robot lookalikes ventured to the depths of the ocean floor to interact with their animal counterparts, communicating with them and mimicking their patterns. We're happy to answer your questions about how these robots work, what we discovered, and more!

*Spy in the Ocean* is currently airing on PBS on Wednesdays at 8/7c (check local listings). You can watch the first two episodes now at [pbs.org](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/collections/spy-in-the-ocean/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvxs_j5q540bdPfHEZXOD6O5C1NntHdid), or on the [PBS App](https://www.pbs.org/pbs-app/).

How does heat work?,"
What’s happening on a molecular level? I don’t do well with abstract thought so I’ll provide an “experiment” and hopefully someone clever can explain it to me.

Say I have two dry kidney beans. I put one on a sunny windowsill on a hot day and I put the other one in the freezer. An hour later, I take both beans and put them side by side on a plate on the kitchen table. After some time, they both return to room temperature. 

My questions are numbered but you don’t have to answer them directly like this, it just makes it easier for me:

1. If I put the beans under a super strong microscope that could show me the molecules (or whatever level we’d have to be observing to see what we want to see) while they were still hot/cold, how could I recognize by observation alone which one was hot and which one was cold?

2. What would the molecules in each bean do as it cooled/warmed up, respectively?

3. If the beans on the plate existed in a small vacuum universe, just big enough for the beans and a few cubic inches of air around them, how would their respective temperatures effect each other or the air as their temperature equalized? Would you be able to see the air around the hot bean heat up as the hot bean itself cools down, and what would that look like?

4. What causes temperature to equalize (why do hot things cool down, why do cold things warm up?)

Does yeast travel along bubbles?,"I started a new batch of mead relying on the yeast naturally occurring in raw honey.

I'm wondering how this impacts the exange of oxygen to yeast in the mixture? What passes along the 'skin' of a bubble? Is it a static structure until it pops or do sugar and water molecules flow along the surface? And if those things do flow, do yeast cells travel along the surface? 

Side notes for those interested. After the yeast peaks in activity it will move to an air locked environment to encourage alcohol production and give time for the yeast to break down the fructose, which takes longer. The source of my knowledge is coming from The Art of Fermentation by Sandor Ellix Katz. This isn't the first time following this method and harmful contamination risks are pretty low and very detectable.

How do molecule bonds work (like ionic and covalent bonding) with the concept that electrons are actually fields?,"Preface: I only have high school / freshman level scientific knowledge of chemistry, but I have a stronger background in Physics (several higher level classes in university)

In high school chemistry we are given the knowledge and run on the assumption that electrons are solid objects orbiting various levels of energy from the nucleus, and things like donating electrons in ionic bonding and covalent bonding is the sharing of valence electrons to allow both atoms to reach the maximum number of electrons in a certain shell.

Once I got to slightly more advanced physics and understood the wave-particle behavior of electrons, I cannot make the link between how the bonding works when the concept of an electron can now be described as a field. Does it just bypass this entire concept together, only interacting as the particle section of the wave-particle duality?

Most of the documentation I've read is often too hard for me to piece together, so any help would be appreciated.",askscience,1698972860.0,t3_17miulx,post

"A question about light speed, and how it works on a Seesaw?","Hello, everyone, this is a weird question but it's one that has been going around in my head for a few days and I dont know how to answer. For context I was thinking about lightspeed and how its impossible to go faster than it but I got this idea into my head and I can't get it out.

Imagine a Seesaw floating in outer space, the ""plank"" is perfectly rigid and the plank its 2 lightseconds long. If I were to push down on one end of the seesaw, would the other end go up 2 seconds later or would it start moving at the same time? (asuming that the center doesnt move down when you push it down).  Also, what would happen if I just push the whole seesaw from the center down, would ends of it go down at the same time or would they go down a second later?

I don't understand enough to actually come up with an answer, so if someone could help me understand this, provably stupid question, that would be amazing.

Thanks!

Edit: First of all thank you to everyone that answered this, some of it goes over my head but I feel like I have learned a lot, so thank you everyone who took the time to answer my question.

Second, just to dispel a misconception, I asked this question out of ignorance not as a gotcha to relativity or to just make stuff up. I was not aware that a perfectly rigid object was such an impossibility that it breaks physics, in my ignorance I thought that saying perfectly rigid was akin to disregarding friction in an equation to makes things simpler. I now understand that that was VERY dumb of me, so sorry about that. But hey I learned something new so thanks everyone.  

After reading everything I now understand that i should have said something like maximum possible rigidity for my thought experiment, which was poorly worded because I just didn't know any better so sorry about that.",askscience,1698925259.0,t3_17m1k7t,post

Is it possible for the axis of a planet to always be pointed roughly towards the sun that it orbits?,"It has been a long time since I have taken physics, but I believe my question essentially boils down to can a planet rotate around two different axes such that the north pole is always tilted towards the star? I understand that seasons are caused by the tilt of the earth causing the North hemisphere to receive more sunlight than the south hemisphere for half a year and vice versa. Would it be possible for a planet to orbit a star in a way that the axis is always leaning towards the sun? I believe this would mean that the planet is orbiting around one axis (such as north and south poles) as well as another axis perpendicular to the plane of the orbit allowing the north pole to always be angled towards the sun. Would the axis of the north and south poles have to intersect with the star for this to be achieved, or could the angle of the axis be angled above or below the star?

Where do the relativistic corrections in fine structure come from?,"for context my background is a single course of QM.

i read that the fine structure is cause by corrections due to relativistic considerations (along with spin contribution).

here's my issue: arent the electrons in the atomic structure standing waves? as in, they are not propagating, so there is no relative velocity between them and the frame of reference (the nucleus).

my understanding is that the electrons can't be moving because if they were then they'd be radiating due to moving through the nucleus' E-field, which they aren't. not to mention if they ARE in motion then they're also all moving relative to each other's E-field in a multi-e system.

Why are valleys so much wider in the Rockies and Coastal Mountains than in the Appalachians?,"With the exception of the Mohawk & Champlain valleys, the mountainous valleys here on the eastern half of the country are typically thin and narrow with a river or stream surrounded on both sides by forested mountains and hills with maybe a thin strip of flat land with a small village or town on the banks of the river usually connected by one or two roads along either side of the river and maybe a rail line slowly meandering along the sharp and winding curves of the valley. By contrast from what I’ve seen the Rockies and Western Ranges seem to be dominated by wide expansive open valleys filled with dry grassland and prairie or at least they seem to be far more common than they are here in the East. Which seems counterintuitive as since the Appalachians are much older you’d expect erosion to widen the valleys as the rock nearer to the tops of the mountains would erode quicker than those at the bottom smoothing out the slope and increasing deposition of sediment at the bottom expanding the distances between both the starts and peaks of mountains and creating wider valleys?

This Halloween, ask us all your bat-related questions!","Hi Reddit! We are biologists from the University of Maryland here to answer all of your bat-related questions.

**[Gerald (Jerry) Wilkinson](https://biology.umd.edu/people/gerald-wilkinson)** is a professor in the University of Maryland Department of Biology who conducts research on social behavior, with emphasis on how genetic mechanisms may influence the outcome of evolution. He has studied several species of bats, including vampire bats, in the Neotropics and the US to understand cooperative behavior and communication. Recently, his lab has used DNA methylation to predict age in bats and discovered that extreme longevity, which has evolved in multiple bat lineages, is associated with changes in methylation near genes involved in immunity. Current projects aim to identify epigenetic changes associated with social stress, immune function, and sex differences in aging in bats.

**Katherine Armenta** is a third-year Ph.D. student in the University of Maryland Behavior, Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics program (BEES). She is studying one of the most abundant bat species in Maryland, Eptesicus fuscus, or the big brown bat, and its communication and social behavior within and across species.

**Danielle Adams** is a postdoc in the Wilkinson Lab at the University of Maryland. She is studying the interactions between stress, aging, and immunity in wild bats. During her Ph.D. (UMD '19), she studied sexual selection in phyllostomid bats, a diverse family of leaf-nosed bat species found in the Neotropics. Prior to studying bats, Danielle studied vocal communication and the use of imitation in wild parrots. She also holds a master's in conservation biology (Columbia University '10).

We'll be on from **12 to 2:30 p.m. ET (16:00-18:30 UT)**, ask us anything!

What is the maximum bitrate of a radio transmitter operating at a given frequency?,"Hello, so, I've noticed that in the past, for narrowband (up to 5Khz sound) analogue voice transmission the radio frequencies used were in the hundreds of Khz up several Mhz, wideband sound (FM radio) uses frequences of tens to hundreds of Mhz and modern digital wireless transmission uses radio waves in the Ghz range, with 5G FR2 going into the tens of Ghz range. The trend is clear - more modern methods of wireless communication use higher frequency waves, with less range.

Am I correct in assuming this is because at high frequencies, even if you only occupy a small portion of the frequency you still got a huge bandwidth? And using the traditional Long Wave, Medium Wave and Short Wave frequencies, just how good of a bitrate could be achieved if instead of transmitting sound a digital mode using all advances in modern technology (most modern modulation etc.) are used?

Why were lines of longitude defined differently from lines of latitude? (ie not parallel),"I understand that lines of longitude converge at the poles, but why were they made to do that when lines of latitude run parallel to each other? 

Or maybe what I want to know is, why don’t we have another set of lines that run north and south but remain parallel to each other? 

I think I can understand why you don’t need converging lines that run east to west, but if parallel lines are helpful running east and west, wouldn’t they be helpful running north and south too?

Edit: Apologies that this is so unclear, it was very hard to find the wording to convey my question. Maybe what I should have asked is, why is it helpful to  measure latitudinally using nearly cylindrical parallel divisions, where we measure the earth longitudinally in converging divisions that make a shape like an orange carpel (again, I am running out of words here).

Second Edit: CrustalTrudger helped me understand that the lines of longitude and latitude were defined as they were primarily because of their relation to the sun and the poles and their usefulness in navigation. The lines of longitude are not just measuring the difference between places on the earth, but  instead are something like tracking the places which are directly under the sun at the same time. This would have been more practical at the time than covering the globe in a grid of arbitrary parallel lines. The latitudinal lines are even distances from the equator which has significance in relation to both the sun and the poles.",askscience,1697762036.0,t3_17by9pd,post
Doesn't this violate the equivalence principle?,"I'm sorry if this has been asked before, I searched on Reddit and Google and could not find this question asked.

If two stationary balls are in a box which has a complete vacuum in deep space, ignoring the gravity of the balls for each other, the balls will just sit in the same spots forever.

However if the balls in the vacuum in the box were freefalling in an orbit around the earth, because the balls independently have elliptical orbits around the earth, they should move towards each other and then away from each other, oscillating back and forth.

Wouldn't this distinguish the first and second scenarios and thus violate Einstein's Equivalence principle? Thanks.

Also, I asked this in /r/physics, but they kept removing it for some reason and would not explain why.",askscience,1697740825.0,t3_17bq8d8,post

How would we know if we were moving at near light speeds?,"If I am walking 5km/h in a train that is moving 100km/h I'm really moving 105km/h relative to the earth. But the earth is moving 107,000 km/h relative to the sun so in a way I'm moving 107105km/h. But our solar system is moving 200,000km/s through the milky way so add that also... etc, etc etc.  
Now I realize that the speed of light is the fastest anything can move. And I know that time changes depending on the speed you are going. But I have also been led to believe that the object that is moving at great speed is experiencing time slower than those moving slower, yet to the object itself time still seems to move the same while the outside world form its perspective seems to speed up.

  
1. Since speed is relative and there is no fixed point to use as a speed of zero, if a planet was already moving at near light speed relative to another point in space how would its inhabitants even know that they were moving that fast?

  
2. If I, along with my world, was already moving this fast would my interpretation of light speed still just be an additional 300,000km/s relative to me?

  
3. What does this mean for the passage of time on other planets that are moving at a different speed through the universe relative to Earth?",askscience,1697732457.0,t3_17bn18x,post
Could we tell if some oceanic exoplanets could have life from space?,"If I'm not wrong, from what I heard and searched, we find exoplanets with advanced telescopes and other tools. Some of those planets are speculated to have ocean-like liquids. Now that's just a scientist's guess when they gather info about the exoplanet, but like with Coral reefs being visible from space, can the same be possible from, let's say footages of these planets? Like, zooming on the footage and observing the oceans from there?

However, I'm aware that if those planets had something similar like Coral reefs here, we could identify alien life already. To simplify the question, if we find an alien planet with oceans, would it be likely that we could find some visible life activity from space footage, similar to coral reefs on Earth?

How do we know that Neanderthals and Denisovans were another species and not just another race of H.

Srsly nature is nasty) and so on. Learning that trans genus trans family and sometimes trans order hybrids were possible blew my mind, and left me with difficult questions about how and why we classify animals.

By that definition, isn't the protoplasm just the cell? at least in a cell without a cell wall that description includes every single part of a cell, so what's even the point of the word protoplasm?

While serving in this role, I publicly shared my own journey with bipolar disorder to help dispel stigma and internalized shame, and to spread hope and light - pursuits I continue to prioritize.

I previously served on Stanford's faculty as a pediatrician and conducted gender, mental health, and health equity research. My areas of expertise are: trauma-informed systems, stress and resilience, gender and health equity, and child health. Now, I advise entities that aim to advance resilience or equity. This includes serving on the national Board of Directors for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).

I spent my early years between the Philippines, India and the US; I'm an immigrant and a first-generation American. I'm also raising a sweetheart of a toddler with my partner of 17 years, while living nomadically - a fun and action-packed journey.

Today, I'm partnering with Number Story to raise awareness around how early adversity and stress can impact our health and well-being - and more importantly, to share tools and strategies for preventing and reversing these impacts.

What is happening in this simulation of a particle scattering with quantum physics?,"[This video shows a quantum simulation made by solving the Schrödinger equation for a particle scattering in three different lattices.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kXGb0_-1iY)

Initially, the particle seems sensible - it's a packet of waves that behaves like a particle in the aggregate. But once it starts scattering, nothing makes sense to me anymore.

1. It is my understanding that particles are discrete - you can't have half a photon. But in this simulation, the scattering pushes half of it through the lattice and half reflects backwards!

2. Scattering seems to disperse the energy of the particle over a large (and infinitely expanding) area of space. Is the particle destroyed after this? I didn't think particles could be destroyed. 

3. What would happen if you observed this particle after the scattering? Would all these waves collapse into a single discrete particle again? How does this process work?",askscience,1697535194.0,t3_179uf3n,post

and have seen multiple posts in the past of the ""sounds of space"" like stars, and the moon.

My limited knowledge on this subject is really basic. Obviously every body in the universe has a ""frequency"" but how are space scientists creating sound out of it? and why is it useful?",askscience,1697174105.0,t3_176r4ra,post

"What is the actual deepest river in the US, also what is the actual deepest river in the world? Do we truly know?","I was on a Wikipedia reading about Socotra Island, and after clicking more hyperlinks than I can remember, somehow ended up on the page for the Congo River. It is claimed the Congo is the deepest river in the world, at 720 feet. Out of curiosity o googled the depths of various other rivers, the Amazon, Mississippi, Missouri, and Columbia Rivers. Once I googled the Columbia River, the top featured snippet was from Wikipedia, which claimed “Water depths have been estimated at 1,000 ft at Wallula Gap and 400 ft over modern Portland, Oregon.” I then researched further and found on usgs dot gov “Depths to 300 feet have been measured near the Dallas, Oregon.” 

I then searched for the deepest river in the US, and was met with every single site (though none reliable like USGS) claiming the Hudson River is the deepest river in the US, with a maximum depth of 216 feet.

So what is it? Is the Congo the deepest river in the world at 720 feet or is it actually the Columbia River at 1,000 feet? Is the deepest river in the US the Hudson River at 216 feet?

"AskScience AMA Series: Astronomer here! I am Dr. Yvette Cendes, a radio astronomer who specializes in transient signals ranging from ""burping"" black holes to looking for (natural) radio emission from exoplanets. In addition to this am also known for dropping astro knowledge around Reddit. AMA!","Radio astronomer here! Many of you may already know me by my user name, /u/Andromeda321, which I've used for many years now to drop astronomy/space facts, or give context on new space discoveries in science. In the real world, my name is Yvette Cendes, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Next summer, however, I will begin as an assistant professor of physics at the University of Oregon, where I will focus on building the department's astronomy course and research offerings- go ducks!

Radio astronomy is a powerful tool to learn more about our cosmos- different physical processes emit light at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and radio waves can often reveal information you can't learn from other wavelengths. My particular specialty are ""transient"" signals- ones that turn on and off over time, instead of being constant (like most things in the universe are during the course of our lifetime). This has covered a huge range of phenomena, and certainly keeps things exciting- during my career I have studied things such as supernovae, potential radio emission from exoplanets (which would be generated by the planet's magnetosphere), and even the closest black holes we know of to Earth!

Most recently, however, I have focused most of my research on ""burping"" black holes- a new and unexpected phenomenon in black hole physics. This occurs years after a star wanders too close to a supermassive black hole, and is torn apart by tidal forces, in an event known as a Tidal Disruption Event (TDE). Outflows from these events generate radio emission, and was traditionally thought to occur only in the first ~months post-disruption, but my team has discovered an astounding ~40% of TDEs will have detectable radio emission *years* post-disruption that don't at early times! This is incredibly exciting because it opens a new door to studying black hole physics- you can read a recent news article about this discovery [here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7e4bb/a-wild-and-mysterious-discovery-just-upended-our-idea-of-black-holes), and a much more detailed summary of our preprint paper [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/164n35e/i_have_discovered_that_up_to_half_of_all_black/). Additionally, last year I discovered that one of these ""burping"" black holes has an outflow with a velocity up to half the speed of light, [known as AT2018hyz, or ""Jetty McJetface.""](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/black-hole-belches-out-remnants-of-gobbled-star-years-after-initial-meal/)

When not doing research or hanging out around Reddit, I am also involved in outreach, writing for publications like *Astronomy* magazine and serving as the astronomy editor for the *Guinness Book of World Records*. I also maintain an active subreddit at /r/Andromeda321, and maintain a [Twitter/X account](https://twitter.com/whereisyvette) (though don't post much there any more) and a much more active one at BluSky [@whereisyvette.bsky.social](https://staging.bsky.app/profile/whereisyvette.bsky.social).

"When immature (human) eggs die, where do they physically go?","I've always heard that women are born with all the eggs they'll ever have, and I (24F) assumed that that meant like..... 500 eggs? Because there's 1 per menstrual cycle for 40ish years. 

I feel very silly now because apparently female fetuses have MILLIONS of eggs and we lose them over time. From what I'm reading, girls are born with around 1-2 million, and then by puberty have around 300,000-400,000 left, and then post-puberty about 1,000/month die. 

My question is: what actually happens to the cells? Every written-for-laypeople article that I can find just says that X amount of immature eggs die per month, but where do the cells go? Do they stay dead in the ovary? Are they shedded as part of menstruation? Or do they get broken down and reabsorbed into the body somehow... (?)

And the way an old school radio worked was actually just 'tapping' into a different length of the radio's antenna to match the radio wave width that corresponds with the station i turned to.

I operated under that knowledge for the better part of 30 years until I learned that the FM radio waves are over 10 feet wide (3.3m) half an hour ago.

What is the difference in impact between ocean warming caused by ocean acidification and warming caused by heat energy from the sun?,"From what I understand, there are 'two' major threats posed to the ocean, which can both be directly attributed to global warming, but for two different reasons. Ocean acidification as a result of rising co2 emissions, meaning more carbon in the atmosphere, which dissolves in seawater and creates a higher carbon content, thus leading to a lower pH level and increased acidity. More acidity creates a multitude of problems, with coral bleaching, danger posed to calcifying organisms no longer able to create shells, and other larger impacts on the marine ecosystem in general.

What I'm confused about, however, is warming of the ocean that isn't directly due to acidification (in terms of a higher co2 content), and instead, an increase in the oceans temperatures due to it trapping more excess heat than it can hold. Is this actually even a phenomenon or is ocean warming strictly due to an increase in emissions? ",askscience,1696942155.0,t3_174kch0,post

Is Slab pull really the dominant force behind tectonic plates movement?,"I have been reading about what makes the tectonic plates move. At first, i came across this ""passive plate tectonic"" theory that mantle convections are the main force behind the movement of tectonic plates. which makes sense to me. However, now it is considered rather obsolete and ""Active plate tectonics"" theory takes its place which explains the motion of plates in term of gravity. According to it, ridge push and, more dominant one, slab pull derives the plate movement and convection current.   
However, i cannot seem to get the grasp of it and there are few lacunas in my mind:

1. There is no slab pull or ridge push if oceanic ridges aren't already formed. Like if there is no divergent boundary in the first place, there will be no raised surface at oceanic ridge and as a result no subduction zones. So, something must have been there to create this divergent boundary and the resulting subduction zones. **if it's not mantle convection then what?** i mean one can use this active theory to explain difference in the movements of different plates or how fast they are moving as compared to mantle convections but i don't know how can it explain the very first plate movement that gave rise to this slab pull and ridge push.
2. If mantle convections really aren't strong enough to make the plates move and slab pull is the one then what is happening at Convergent boundaries of two continental crust?

Dissolved Oxygen vs Density of Water?,"
I’m a wastewater operator. We have grit channels that are designed to aerate water to lower the density of incoming wastewater so that anything solid (sand, egg shells, ashes…) can fall out and be collected. Our governing body and manuals state “a properly aerated grit channel will remove up to 100% of grit” but nobody can tell us what “properly aerated” means. We are told that grit needs to move 0.5-1.0 feet per second through the channel but there is no way to measure that because the aeration creates turbulence across the water. Besides trial and error the only control option we have is dissolved oxygen content. So scientists of this app please tell me, at what dissolved oxygen in mg/L does the density of water change? It would be nice to get the density below 0.8 g/cm^3 so all grit can be removed early in the process to prevent damage to my pumps and pipes and not have to be removed manually later by shovels hoses and vactor trucks.",askscience,1696016808.0,t3_16vldcn,post

is it easier to change the premises or the conclusions in someone's reasoning?,"To me the answer seems obvious, that - all other things being equal - if someone has a train of reasoning in mind, where they think ""A"" and ""B because of A"", then it should be easier to change ""B"" than to change ""A"", i.e. it's easier to change conclusions than premises, since changing premises will tend to require also changing conclusions, and since that's more work it's harder to do.

To be clear, this is a question about psychology/thinking, *not* about logic or idealized deduction. I don't assume that human thought is especially rational or logical, generally, just that it does often involve these kinds of dependent relations between ideas.

I'm looking for studies from experimental psychology (or ""behavioral economics"" etc) that demonstrate such a difference, or that demonstrate that the obvious answer is actually not true and that the opposite is more likely the case (that it's easier to change premises than conclusions) - or that it's totally more complicated than this.

"In survival situations, in terms of controlling caloric intake and preservation, is gorging and rationing food equivalent?","Let's say I have a food source that amounts to 20,000 calories but I'm worried about protecting it from scavengers, predators, spoilage, etc.

Intuitively, it seems to make more sense to try and risk rationing the food. There might be some loss, but maybe rationing helps curb hunger and maybe the daily dopamine hit from small rations has an unmeasuable positive, psychological impact.

But strictly in terms of caloric intake, is there a quantitative difference between eating 20,000 calories worth of food over four days as opposed to eating 500 or 1000 calories a day (assuming a daily requirement of 2000 calories)?

Does your body spend energy to store the excess calories, and does that amount of energy negate eating more than your daily requirements? That is, how much energy is required to store the excess calories? Would there be an ""optimal"" amount of over eating?

On the flipside, does your body have to spend energy breaking down fat and muscle in order to supplement the caloric deficient, and does that amount of energy negate the logic of rationing?",askscience,1695663848.0,t3_16ryq2x,post

Understanding dip angle with respect to earth's magnetic field?,"I read following [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dip):

>Magnetic dip, dip angle, or magnetic inclination is the angle made with the horizontal by the Earth's magnetic field lines. This angle varies at different points on the Earth's surface. Positive values of inclination indicate that the magnetic field of the Earth is pointing downward, into the Earth, at the point of measurement, and negative values indicate that it is pointing upward. The dip angle is in principle the angle made by the needle of a vertically held compass, though in practice ordinary compass needles may be weighted against dip or may be unable to move freely in the correct plane. The value can be measured more reliably with a special instrument typically known as a dip circle.  
>  
>Magnetic dip results from the tendency of a magnet to align itself with lines of magnetic field. As the Earth's magnetic field lines are not parallel to the surface, the north end of a compass needle will point upward in the southern hemisphere (negative dip) or downward in the northern hemisphere (positive dip).

However if you check [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic_Dip.svg) on wikipedia, it does not seem to match with above explanation. Or I am reading it wrong? (Sorry for giving external link to diagram, but this subreddit does not seem to allow embedding diagrams in the post.)

To be precise, this is what I did not understood:

1. Is the diagram indeed show compass needle by pointy shape above red-blue magnets? (I will assume yes in question 2 onwards)
2. The diagram shows that in the top most magnet has niddle pointing upward. However the article says:

Why do nearby places have opposite tides?,"I am in Seattle looking at tides on Vancouver Island (specifically Bamfield station). 

Relative to the planet at large these locations are pretty nearby each other only 160 miles. The moon is almost the same direction from each. But today 9/30 in Seattle we have low tide at around noon but Bamfield will have their high tide just a little later at 1:40PM.  How can places so nearby have such disparate tides if the main driver is the moon? shouldn't that pull the high tide across the area as the earth turns?  is it entirely down to interference of the islands int he Salish sea? I would think that if islands were slowing water then the high and low would stay around the same time but that Seattle would just experience less extremes, the way we would in tsunami situations. This is clearly not the case since the tides are almost flipped.

Some of the offset is for the same reason that dawn is at different times across the same time zone but that isn't enough for it to entirely flip. in fact accounting for Banfield being further west makes it look even more neatly inverted.  

Many tide questions in this forum are about the Maine/Atlantic Canada situation and there's good info about why tides across that area share similarities. but why do tides in this area have such difference?",askscience,1695545354.0,t3_16qspys,post

Or how much water is being displaced when a mid-ocean volcano is pushing up a new island?

Is the continental shift so small that it doesn't factor in any meaningful way from year to year? I assumed it would, considering the sea rise is talked about as centimeters over a decade, which is a similar scale to the movement of continents.",askscience,1694976462.0,t3_16l8od4,post

Where does energy go after it is used?,"
I’m 4th grade teaching energy and I know that energy cannot be created or destroyed but I cannot figure out how the full cycle, cycles. 

For example, I eat a muffin before a race, the energy for the muffin fuels my body while I run and while I run I exert energy that moves my body. Where does *that* energy go? And then where does it go from where to end up theoretically, back into another muffin? 

My kids need answers so now I need answers 😵‍💫

Edit: omg thank you all for the input i did not think so many people would respond. I’m gonna read through it all and translate it into 9 year old terminology now LOL TY

Edit 2: I realize I know nothing and now I am confused if energy cannot be created or destroyed, then do we have limited energy since useless energy is *useless*?

Edit 3: so here is what I have gathered in a way that is digestible for 9 year olds 
 - sun energy goes to plants goes to animals animals get that energy to do animal things and is released mostly as heat and goes into air and exists, but is useless. It’s similar to matter, like when you fart the gas bubble has escaped, the gas still exists, but it’s diluted so much in space/around us that it is useless and will go unnoticed.  Energy cannot be created or destroyed in the same sense that matter cannot be created or destroyed",askscience,1694922357.0,t3_16kqnou,post

Feynman's Explanation of Light Travelling in a Straight line in QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter doesn't seem to make sense to me?,"I'm currently going into my third year of my MSci in Theoretical Physics (though I've gotten rusty over the summer and am trying to get back into the swing of things, so I might just be being an idiot or forgetting something lol).  
  
  
  
I was reading Richard Feynman's book QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter and found his explanation of why light travels in a straight line not very satisfying. Here is a link to a pdf of this section of the book https://faculty.washington.edu/seattle/physics441/feynman-QED/qed2.pdf (specifically around page 53).  
  
  
  
I'm probably just not understanding Feynman, but from what I understand from his examples and diagram on page 53, the paths that are nearly straight between points S to P generally have a very similar phase (or as per the analogy Feynman uses, have very similar stopwatch hand directions) and thus they contribute together greatly. In contrast other longer paths (like paths A and B) and their neighbors have much larger phase differences, so they are more likely to cancel each other out, thus leaving the contributions of the more direct paths. While this is convincing with the paths Feynman has outlined in the book, when looking at *every* path a photon could take we can very easily imagine many long, non-direct paths with very similar phases. Would Feynman's logic not also apply to these paths?  
  
One answer to that question I can imagine is that when looking at every non-direct path, they will all end up cancelling each other out by the end of it, but why does this not happen for the direct path? I can imagine an answer for this coming from symmetry of the diagram, which would just leave the singular direct path as the only path left contributing but Feynman also emphasizes that its not only the direct path that contributes, but also paths like C and E. Why do these paths not get cancelled out? Is it that no path is fully cancelled out, but the more direct path just contributes far greater than non-direct paths, so we only really notice the biggest contribution i.e the direct path?  
  
Another thing which I am not too sure of is surely there are also non-direct paths which share the phase of the direct path, so would we not also perceive light as travelling down those paths, not only as a straight line? Are there for whatever reason less non-direct paths with this phase, so while we may be able to detect these paths, they aren't as obvious as the direct path?  
  
  
  
Sorry if these questions seem a bit confused, I can clarify in the comments a bit as best I can. It's not always easy to explain what exactly you don't understand about something. I also understand the Feynman has simplified this quite a bit, so that may be where my confusion is coming from.",askscience,1694785149.0,t3_16jdplm,post

Why do many orthopaedic surgeons discourage weightlifting when research encourages it?,"For surgically treated (osteotomies) hip dysplasia (HD) I know several orthopaedic surgeons that discourage any kind of high impact activities; no jumping, running, lower body weight lifting (beyond even 5lbs), excessive hip flexion, etc. even years after surgery. The only exercises recommended were the elliptical and cycling, with light resistance activities (ex. with an ankle weight) and this advice has persisted until now. When I asked for more information, one doctor explained high impact exercises would degrade the hips faster because surgeries to fix HD create an abnormal joint shape that, with weight-bearing, degrade the connected bone due to the absence of cartilage to mitigate the friction.

However, I studied bio-medical science and read several journal articles published in the last 20 years that have *recommended* (or have not discouraged) weight lifting (high impact) with HD. I did not evaluate any articles based on if they were RCTs, nor did I weigh different sample sizes, length of follow-up, etc. I don't believe any of the linked studies looked at long-term outcomes (10+ years) of high impact activities on the actual bone, just reported pain and strength levels:

* [Feasibility and acceptability of a six-month exercise and patient education intervention for patients with hip dysplasia: A mixed methods study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468781222001151): progressive resistance training improved pain levels and hip strength.
* [Progressive resistance training in patients with hip dysplasia: A feasibility study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30132502/): Progressive resistance training led to stronger leg muscles and better pain levels.\*(fixed the link)
* [Does hip muscle strength and functional performance differ between football players with and without hip dysplasia?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37598519/): Similar levels of hip muscle strength and functional performance were found in active football players with and without hip dysplasia. Authors were not sure if it was due to less advanced HD being present.
* [Rehabilitation Guidelines for Use Following a Periacetabular Osteotomy (PAO): A North American Based Delphi Consensus:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9528724/) a panel of physiotherapists recommend a full return to sports with no limitations to weight-bearing activities 20 weeks after osteotomies (surgery to mediate HD)

However, my question is why orthopaedic doctors believe high impact activities have such a negative impact on HD when the (limited) research I've read point in the opposite direction. Is this just established knowledge among surgeons that has not been researched properly? Am I not researching the right terms or journals?

This question has confused me, so I would appreciate any answers! Thank you.  


  
Edit: By contrast, as study [Activity level and severity of dysplasia predict age atbernese periacetabular osteotomy for symptomatichip dysplasia](https://core.ac.uk/reader/70385647) found a correlation between high activity levels (measured on a scale from low to high impact) in those with hip dysplasia and fewer years before the need for an osteotomy (hip surgery).   


Like the above research, can't really answer my question, but there is evidence of a negative effect of high impact activities on prognosis. They used the UCLA score of activity with high impact examples like jogging, tennis, sports, skiing, etc. and didn't mention weightlifting, but I think it's safe to include in the list.",askscience,1694667957.0,t3_16i9ddg,post

Are there any examples in evolutionary history of parasitic relationships evolving to symbiotic ones (or vice versa)?,"On face value, it seems to me a parasitic relationship is unstable because of the parasite's conflicting interests. On the one hand, it has to drain the host for food/reproduction. On the other, it can't kill the host (too early) because it depends on it for survival. 

But if this is true, then parasitic relationships would have the tendency to break down or evolve into symbiotic ones, right?",askscience,1694014811.0,t3_16bniki,post

"How special is mathematical ""uniqueness""?","*edit* thanks all for the responses, I have learned some things here, this was very helpful.

Question background:

""Uniqueness"" is a concept in mathematics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_theorem

The example I know best is of Shannon information: it is proved to be the *unique measure* of uncertainty that satisfies some specific axioms. I kind of understand the proof. 

And I have heard of other measures that are said to be *the unique measure* that satisfies whatever requirements - they all happen to be information theory measures.

So, part 1 of my question: is ""uniqueness"" a concept restricted to IT-like measures (the link above says no to this *specifically*)? Or is it very general, like, does it makes sense to say that there's a unique function for *anything* measurable? Like, is f = ma the ""unique function"" for measuring force, in the same sense as sum(p log p) is the unique measure of uncertainty in the Shannon sense?

Part 2 of my question is: how special is uniqueness? Is every function a unique measure of *something*? Or are unique measures rare and hard to find? Or something in-between?",askscience,1694030088.0,t3_16bu4sl,post

"Rocky exoplanets recorded are often larger than the Earth (Due to detection bias), but how do we know it's a single planet and not a planetary system?","Edit: By planetary system I mean a binary system 

I'm assuming it would be all but impossible to single out one or multiple moons around a rocky planet hundreds of light years away, but whenever I see an announcement of a new exoplanet ""nearly"" the size of the Earth, there never seems to be any doubt that it's a singular planet, as opposed to a binary system like our own. 

Granted, I think the moon is like 1/80th the mass of Earth, so if an alien observer viewed earth through a telescope similar to our own, the size of our earth probably wouldn't be swayed all that much by the presence of a moon, but who's to say all binary systems have such size discrepancy between them? Is it just basic physics that disallow such systems to exist for long periods of time?

Is there a possibility that a lot of the ""larger"" rocky planets with twice the mass of our earth could, in fact, be a system consisting of a planet closer in size to our own, but with one or multiple moons?",askscience,1693910363.0,t3_16akpx6,post

"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Dr. Prosanta Chakrabarty, an evolutionary biologist at LSU (Louisiana State University) and the author of a new popular science book that is a broad overview of the science of evolution, including why it matters in our everyday lives... AMA!","Hi, I'm Prosanta, and I'm excited to answer all the questions you have about evolution (but have been afraid to ask). I think the science of evolution remains controversial among the general public (not among scientists) because the topic hasn't been explained very well and the facts are often misunderstood. After moving to Louisiana from New York City, where I grew up, the Governor of my adopted state, Bobby Jindal, passed a law that allowed public school teachers to introduce non-science (including religious) perspectives as alternatives when teaching evolution and other scientific topics. That's when I started to write my new book Explaining Life Through Evolution.

With the teaching of evolution being recently removed or banned from places like India and Türkiye (formally known as Turkey), and with more and more people learning about their ancestry from DNA tests, and with new gene editing tools like CRISPR becoming available, I think it is more important than ever that everyone understand evolution. The consequences of not understanding evolution have led to the promotion of racism and eugenics that are not in line with the science.

What caused Carbon Dioxide levels to fall so much during the Late Eocene?,"Earlier today, I was looking up what caused the glaciation of Antarctica, and also when it took place.

What I couldn't seem to find was an explanation as to ***why*** there was a global drop in CO₂ during the Late Eocene. The Azolla event is theorised to have been responsible for a similar drawdown during the Middle Eocene, but is separated from the Late Eocene by the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum, a period when CO₂ levels were among their highest.

To go from the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum to global temperatures being cool enough to allow permanent ice sheets to form over Antarctica, the drop in CO₂ levels in the Late Eocene must surely have been dramatic, but I couldn't seem to find an explanation as to what had caused/contributed to it.",askscience,1705772614.0,t3_19bh84f,post

Do animals that live in the dark have sleep cycles in tune with the rotation of the earth?,"So I am rereading Project Hail Mary at the moment. 

In the book, the main character meets an alien, named Rocky, who lives on a planet with such a thick atmosphere that light can't reach the ground. The characters talk with each other about their biology at length in order to learn about one another, and they talk a lot about sleep, too. Rocky has a weird sleep cycle and lives on a planet that also spins very fast. His sleep cycle does not seem to match his planet's day-night cycle. 

This got me wondering about Earth life. From what I understand, all animals sleep, it's almost a biological mandate. Even though some are nocturnal, it seems that sleep cycles are still, somewhat, in tune with the rotation of the Earth. Sunlight would be the main indicator for the body for any creature that can see daylight. 

But what about animals that live in total darkness, like in caves or deep in the ocean? Do we know anything about their sleep patterns? If we do, do they somehow follow a day/night cycle?

Why does hair loss only seem to target our heads while hair growth increases everywhere else on the body?,"The paradox of hair loss is that while we seem to lose the hair on our heads, it tends to increase everywhere else on our bodies.

Does an animal’s emotional state equate to taste of food?,"I’ve recently gotten into charcuterie, and in the textbook I use as my main resource, there is a chapter on whether or not we made better sausages in the past, citing things like: lack of excess preservatives beyond just curing salt or regular salt, hand making the sausages, and having to rely on nature as opposed to manufactured environments to cure and dry sausages. This also made me curious on a wider scale though: did we actually make better food (in regard to animal products like meat and dairy) in the past? When looking it up I came across an answer to a similar question someone asked on Quora (which I’m taking with a grain of salt) that said that due to things like feedlot farming and things like feeding cows corn due to the low cost and efficiency, even though it’s not their regular diet, can cause an animal to be stressed. In turn, apparently the adrenaline and cortisol can affect the taste of the meat. I know that things like diet and exercise for an animal can affect the taste of its meat, but can stress-related chemicals really do the same? And how does this hold true for something like foie gras, where birds certainly must be under stress as they are force fed in order to engorge the liver, yet most people enjoy foie gras for its taste, as well as its texture?",askscience,1705888568.0,t3_19ck9t9,post
Why does singing while playing a flute creates a subharmonic?,"If you play a note of a certain frequency on a flute and simultaneously sing a note at a different frequency, then you create a third frequency that wouldn't be there if you play or sing in isolation - and the frequency of this subharmonic is the difference of the flute frequency and the voice frequency (I'm talking about the fundamental frequencies for simplicity). This is caused by modulation (product rule: cos(f1*x)cos(f2x) = 0.5*(cos(f1-f2)+cos(f1+f2)), which in turn suggests some nonlinearity in the system.

I made some observations about this effect:

1. It is not unique to flutes- works on any wind instrument (commonly known as Growling on saxophones)
2. It is NOT the Tartini tone / missing fundamental / difference tone. I know it might be tempting to classify it as such, but keep in mind that the Tartini tone is just in your head (caused by some nonlinearity in the hearing apparatus). The subharmonic mentioned here is clearly measurable on a spectrogram.
3. Whistling into the flute does not work. Sure, it produces a beat frequency (linear superposition) and a Tartini tone (illusion in your head), but the subharmonic is not visible on the spectrogram. This suggests to me that the nonlinearity that causes the modulation is somehow in the vocal chords. The problem might be somehow linked to coupled oscillators, but beyond me right now.

Do you have an intuitive explanation for this? Thanks!

Escaping from a black hole,"It seems to be commonly understood that, other than some quantum physics particles that can randomly appear outside the event horizon of a small enough black hole, nothing can escape from a black hole because it's gravity well is so strong that escape velocity would exceed the speed of light. It follows that since nothing can exceed the speed of light, then nothing can escape once it is past the event horizon.

But escape velocity is the speed an object needs to be going if it were in free fall to escape the gravity well, like firing a bullet from the surface of the moon. An object can escape a gravity well going slower than escape velocity as long as it is actively thrusting out of it, like the Lunar Module taking off from the moon.

So, disregarding all the strong tidal forces that would stretch and pull an object apart and any funky time dilations going on, wouldn't it theoretically be possible for an object to actively fly itself back out from inside the event horizon of a black hole.",space,1705679330.0,t3_19am37q,post

Impulse Space announces plan to develop high-energy kick stage,"Helios can serve as a transfer stage for transporting satellites weighing up to about 5,000 kilograms from low Earth orbit to geostationary orbit in less than a day.

Tom Mueller, chief executive of Impulse Space and one of the founding employees of SpaceX, said Helios wants to extend the capabilities of vehicles like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 to higher orbits. “SpaceX really got the party started by opening up access to LEO,” he said in an interview. “What Impulse wants to do is what SpaceX did for LEO, but for everything else, all the other high-energy orbits.”

Helios would serve as an additional stage for the Falcon 9. “It’s sized to max out the capability of a Falcon 9,” transporting satellites to GEO in less than 24 hours. “It’s basically giving you two-thirds of the capability of a [Falcon] Heavy without having to throw away a core and for much less money.”",space,1705528032.0,t3_1998rlc,post
The top space industry news stories of the week in under 2 minutes,"Hey everyone! This is my 10th weekly roundup now. Let me know if you’ve got any ideas to improve the format, and please share any news-related thoughts, insights and missed stories with everyone in the comments. Sources are in the comments too.

1/ **Axiom Space's Ax-3 Mission Primed for Launch** Axiom Space's Ax-3 is ready for its January 17 launch, marking the company's third private astronaut mission. The mission faced a few pre-launch issues with the Dragon spacecraft, but these were quickly resolved, ensuring the 4 astronauts, including Turkey’s first, can proceed to the ISS as planned.

2/ **JAXA's MMX Mars Mission Postponed** JAXA's ambitious Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission faces a two-year delay, pushing its launch to 2026. The rescheduling, spurred by technical reviews of the H3 rocket, aims to maximise the mission's chances of success in bringing back samples from Phobos whilst aligning with optimal Mars mission windows.

3/ **D-Orbit Secures $110m** **Series C Funding** Italian space logistics company D-Orbit has secured $110 million in Series C funding, propelling its ambitions in satellite servicing. With this significant financial boost, led by Marubeni Corporation, D-Orbit is poised to expand its operational footprint across Europe, the UK, and the US, promising a new era in space infrastructure services.

4/ **SpaceX Say Starship Loss due to Propellant Venting** SpaceX's Starship IFT-2 loss, attributed to a fire caused by the liquid oxygen venting, has provided critical lessons for future missions. With a better understanding of the incident, SpaceX is now confident in the prospects of their next orbital test flight.

5/ **Starlab Joint Venture Finalized** Airbus and Voyager Space's joint venture, Starlab Space LLC, has been finalized, marking an important step forward for the commercial space station market. Starlab is already attracting significant interest, promising to be a cornerstone in post-ISS space activities.

6/ **SpaceX's Starship Gears Up for Third Test** SpaceX is gearing up for Starship's third test flight in February, focused on propellant transfer demonstrations crucial for future lunar and deep space missions, most notably the Artemis missions. The mission will support their longer term plans of establishing a propellant depot in low Earth orbit, used to fuel lunar lander Starships on their journeys to the moon.",space,1705525786.0,t3_1997u9t,post

Can You Make Silica Aerogel In Space?,"I've recently been reading about theoretical ideas for Mars habitats and silica aerogel comes up as a heating option.

Apparently it is already used on Mars rovers so it has already been used on a small scale.

With the Artemis missions coming up, the idea could be tested on a larger scale.

My question is whether it can be manufactured on the moon or Mars - and ideally autonomously.

So, does the moon or Mars contain the necessary material to make it?

If so, could you have a rover that went around manufacturing it and paving it at the same time?
Or some other method of doing it automatically.

i.e. could a robot improve the potential base area before people got there?",space,1705426495.0,t3_1988mg1,post

The first close-up images of Saturn’s rings,"1) Voyager was the first to image Saturn’s rings in enough detail to make out features like the “spokes” seen here in the B ring on August 22, 1981, from a distance of 2.5 million miles (4 million km). These dusty features, which can stretch up to 12,400 miles (20,000km) in length, vary with time and have no agreed-upon origin.
NASA/JPL-Caltech

2) Saturn’s skinny F ring, imaged November 12, 1980, from 466,000 miles (750,000km), is a complex structure composed of two bright rings encircling a third, fainter ring. Clumps, kinks, and other structures in these rings give them a braided appearance.
NASA/JPL-Caltech

3) False-color images, such as this one taken August 23, 1981, from 1.7 million miles (2.7 million km), highlight the varying chemical composition of the rings, seen as different colors. The C ring appears blue in this composite, while the B ring appears yellow-orange.

83h of NGC7380,"NGC 7380 - The Wizard Nebula

The wizard nebula is a emission nebula with the number Sh2-142. It surrounds the open star cluster NGC 7380, which is also a star forming region.

The young stars of the star forming region ionize the surrounding sulfur, hydrogene and oxygen gas and cause it to glow.

I began to take pictures for this image in late July and concluded at the beginning of November.

The editing of the image accompanied me through the very cloudy time since November and after reprocessing it 22 times, I'm finally happy with the result.

Technical data:

Halpha 351x300sec = 29h15min
Oiii.  269x300sec = 22h25min
Sii.  327x300sec = 27h15min
R.  24x120sec + 29x60sec = 1h17min
G.  26x120sec + 56x60sec = 1h48min

The top 5 space industry news stories of the week in under 2 minutes,"Hey everyone! This is my 9th weekly roundup now. Let me know if you’ve got any ideas to improve the format, and please share any news-related thoughts, insights and missed stories with everyone in the comments. Sources are in the comments too.

1/ **Vulcan Centaur Success and Peregrine Lander Failure** United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur rocket successfully launched the Peregrine lunar lander, heralding its inaugural flight. However, Peregrine suffered a critical propulsion system anomaly post-launch, leading to a fuel leak and ruling out a lunar landing. Efforts now focus on maximizing data collection and extending the spacecraft's operational life.

2/ **SpaceX Eyes February for Third Starship Test Flight** SpaceX is targeting February for its third Starship test flight, aiming to build on previous successes. This high-altitude test is crucial for demonstrating Starship's capabilities, as SpaceX progresses towards its ambitious goals for lunar and Martian exploration.

3/ **NASA Postpones Artemis 2 and 3 Missions** NASA has delayed the Artemis 2 and 3 missions, citing challenges and the need for additional preparation time. Artemis 2, the first crewed Orion spacecraft mission, is now scheduled for 2025, while the Artemis 3 lunar landing mission is pushed to 2026.

4/ **NASA Boosts Funding for Blue Origin and Voyager Space Stations** NASA has increased funding for Blue Origin and Voyager Space under the Commercial LEO Destinations project. This move reinforces NASA's commitment to fostering commercial space stations, ensuring continuous U.S. presence in low Earth orbit.

5/ **China's Einstein Probe: Advancing X-ray Astronomy** China launched the Einstein Probe, equipped with novel ""lobster eye"" optics, to explore X-ray emissions from cosmic phenomena. This mission, part of China's growing space science initiatives, aims to provide new insights into the universe's most violent and fleeting events.",space,1704900967.0,t3_193b1m3,post

NASA selects bold proposal to 'swarm' Proxima Centuries with tiny probes - phys.org,"According to https://phys.org/news/2024-01-nasa-bold-swarm-proxima-centauri.html, NASA has selected a proposal called Swarming Proxima Centuries: ""Their proposal calls for a 100-gigawatt (GW) laser beamer boosting thousands of gram-scale space probes with laser sails to relativistic speed (~10-20% of light). They also proposed a series of terrestrial light buckets measuring a square kilometer (0.386 mi2) in diameter to catch the light signals. By their estimates, this mission concept could be ready for development around midcentury and could reach Proxima Centauri and its Earth-like exoplanet (Proxima b) by the third quarter of this century (2075 or after).""

Their budget is about USD 100 billion. I think NASA should test the concept in small scale, before commiting time and money on the full proposal to Proxima Centuries. The main challenges include developing the powerful laser that operates successfully within budget. And developing the AI to control the probes and implementing the software in low power chips on each probe, minuauturized. A redundant fault tolerant network of chips on each probe will have to survive space cold, low gravity, and radiation. Not to mention the sensors for collecting data, and communication technology for sending the data to earth, all low power, minuauturized, and integrated.

"Hi everyone, I've created the JWST Discovery Tracker","As many of you know, a year ago I've created a website containing every single piece of data from JWST. My motivation was although this powerful telescope got so many people interested in its findings, there isn't a single place containing all of them. Even the official discoveries, posted by NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI, sometimes get posted only of one of the websites (for example: a discovery about a full Einstein ring was only posted on NASA; one about the galaxy M51 was only posted on ESA; and another about the universe expansion rate was only posted on STScI. And it's the tip of my tongue).

And I'm not even talking about the unofficial discoveries, posted by universities and institutes. One really needs to dig hard in the internet to find them. I believe *every* Webb lover deserves a place where they can find every single Webb discovery.

NASA doesn't do it, so I am :)

I've created a section in the feed containing **every JWST discovery**. I've collected the official ones, posted by NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI, and also the unofficial (but confirmed) ones, posted by universities and institutes. I'm highlighting the fact that these are the confirmed ones. If one would like to see also the unconfirmed ones, they can also view them on the feed under [Research Results](https://jwstfeed.com/Home/ApplyChoice?choiceID=2). Up to now there are over 2,000 e-prints.

I worked hard to make sure every discovery will contain the highest resolution images, and I assume most of us are the same here: putting on some music and looking at these wonderful images. In addition, I've tried to provide an additional value for each discovery, such as the raw images the discovery is based on, more images from the original article etc.

Let me know what you think and enjoy!

https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/einstein-probe/mission

Mission Overview

The Einstein Probe (EP) is a mission of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Max Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics (MPE), Germany, dedicated to time-domain high-energy astrophysics. Its primary goals are to discover high-energy transients and monitor variable objects. To achieve this, EP employs a very large instantaneous field-of-view (3600 square degrees), along with moderate spatial resolution (FWHM ~5 arcmin) and energy resolution in the 0.5-5 keV energy band. EP has also the capability of performing fast and deep follow-up observations in the 0.3-10 keV energy band (effective area 2*300 cm2 @ 1 keV; half-power diameter, HPD, ~30 arcsec), as well as of quick downlink of transient alert messages. The launch date is currently foreseen for late 2023.

Instruments

The above requirements can be fulfilled by wide-field X-ray focusing optics, i.e., lobster-eye Micro-Pore Optics (MPO), whose focusing imaging results in a greatly enhanced gain in signal to noise, and hence high detecting sensitivity. EP carries a Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) with a large instantaneous FoV, which adopts such a novel lobster-eye MPO technology.  Complementary to this wide-field instrument is a Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) with a large effective area and a narrow field-of-view.",space,1704790372.0,t3_192ac01,post

Possibly unpopular opinion: NASA’s contamination control program should not exist,"There was actually a time when the Curiosity Rover was diverted from possible LIQUID WATER due to a fear of contamination. Bruh. There are two ultimate reasons why we’re exploring Mars: to gather knowledge for a future colony, and to find life/signs of life. I know Curiosity wasn’t sent up to directly find life, but seriously, this is unacceptable, and it’s not a one time occurrence.

To put it bluntly, there will come a time when every planet and moon in the solar system is contaminated with our microbes. We are humans, biological creatures, when we send humans to other worlds there is ZERO chance we don’t contaminate them. That doesn’t mean their microbes will die off necessarily, but it’s inevitability we should be aware of.

However, I will say that there are certain exceptions to this rule, particularly in the outer solar system. So far every outer solar system orbiter probe has been crashed into a gas giant, this makes sense. There is scientific gain from sending probes into the gas giants, so if it can be justified by a stopping contamination, then by all means.

Tbh, I get the reasoning behind not wanting to contaminate other worlds, and honestly we should try not to do it to the outer solar system moons, not yet at least, because no scientific knowledge is lost from those efforts yet. But with Mars, we have to face the reality that humans will go there, colonize, and that all of our Earthly microbes will “contaminate” the planet. Perhaps we should try to avoid it before we send humans to some extent, but not if potential scientific gain is lost.

Also, it’s worth noting that there’s theoretically Earhtly microbes all over the solar system or will end up there via current missions. The Soviets landed a bunch of probes on the surface of Venus, which means its atmosphere could be loaded with our microbes. JUICE will eventually crash onto Ganymede, Dawn (defunct) onto Ceres, etc. Granted this is all just my opinion so take it with a grain of salt lol, but I genuinely do not see a reason to lose potential scientific gain for “stopping contamination”.",space,1704564396.0,t3_1905yeq,post

Stratospheric tourism over suborbital tourism,"In the past few years, space tourism has become more active than ever, previously it was the occasional billionaire being sent up on Soyuz every now and then, but now SpaceX has contract for five futures missions (Polaris 1-3, dearMoon, and Tito's flight). And additionally, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are now actively sending launchings flights of tourists on suborbital hops quite frequently.

Suborbital space tourism is more popular then ever, and now 60 people have gone to space as passengers via that method. However, the suborbital hop strategy only allocates those people around 5-10 minutes in space, which is quite little compared to the days, weeks, or even months that orbital flights granted their passengers.

The easy argument against the previous statement though is simple: orbital tourism is too expensive for the average customer. Space tourism to orbit costs about $50 million per seat right now, which is a lot more than the $450K it costs to fly with Virgin Galactic for example. However, 5-10 minutes is still not a long time, so perhaps another alternative should be considered.

Another easy alternative is stratospheric tourism, there are currently companies such as World View Enterprises and Space Perspective that seek to creates balloon-based spacecraft that can bring passengers to an altitude of about \~30km above sea level for a few hours, where they'd be above >99% of the atmosphere. The common argument against this idea though is that that's not space, its the stratosphere. Although that's true, ultimately does it even matter?

Suborbital tourism, whether its at 80km or 100km is also in the ""atmosphere"", its in the mesosphere/thermosphere. If you were a person at 30km, 80km, or 100km without a suit or protective barrier of any kind, the result would be the same at each altitude: you become a dead human. Also if you're above >99% of the atmosphere, what you're seeing is gonna look essentially like space.

The purpose of this post isn't just to shit on suborbital tourism, what BO and VG are doing is great for increasing space accessibility. But logically speaking, are there really any downsides for the customer who choose a stratospheric flight over a suborbital one? I suppose they would get any zero-g because its a balloon, but you can also get zero-g here on Earth in planes that go on routes designed to give people the zero-g experience. This means the main difference between stratospheric and suborbital flights for the customer would ultimately be time, they'd get hours in space as opposed to minutes. Even though they technically wouldn't be going into space, is this a better service? What do you all think?",space,1704381801.0,t3_18yfn76,post

Let me know if you’ve got any ideas to improve the format, and please share any news-related thoughts, insights and missed stories with everyone in the comments. Sources are in the comments too.

1/ **SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Launches U.S. Military Spaceplane**

SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket successfully deployed the U.S. Space Force's X-37B spaceplane from Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 28. This launch, a first for the X-37B aboard Falcon Heavy and SpaceX's 97th in 2023, carried a payload of U.S. military and NASA experiments. Details of the mission and its intended orbit are classified, yet it's anticipated to surpass the altitudes of previous missions.

2/ **Axelspace secures $44 Million in Series D Funding**

Japanese Earth observation company Axelspace raised nearly $44 million in Series D funding to expand its satellite constellation and develop smallsats for other applications. The Tokyo-based firm, which operates five microsatellites offering medium-resolution imagery, will also support its AxelLiner initiative for producing microsatellites for customers, with a demo satellite launch planned for early 2024.

3/ **Elon Musk reiterates stance on taking Starlink public**

Elon Musk reiterated his reluctance to take Starlink public in the near term, emphasizing the need for stable and predictable cash flows before considering an IPO. SpaceX's Starlink, with over 5,200 satellites in orbit and 2.3 million users, is focused on expanding global broadband coverage. Musk has often contrasted SpaceX's private funding model with that of publicly traded companies, citing long-term planning advantages of remaining private.

4/ **NASA Advances Earth System Observatory Missions**

NASA is advancing its ambitious Earth System Observatory, a series of costly Earth science missions, amidst budget uncertainties. These pivotal missions, integral to NASA's future Earth science endeavors, are currently in development stages, aiming for launches from late 2020s to early 2030s. Despite facing fiscal challenges and dependency on fluctuating budgets, the program has received Senate support.

5/ **Japan's SLIM Spacecraft Preps for Precision Moon Landing**

Japan's SLIM spacecraft, having entered lunar orbit on Dec. 25, is preparing for a precision moon landing on Jan. 19. The mission aims to be Japan’s first lunar soft landing, focusing on accurate landing technology with a lightweight architecture. SLIM carries two innovative rovers and scientific equipment for surface experiments, including analyzing lunar crater compositions. The success of SLIM could reduce future lunar exploration costs.",space,1704298011.0,t3_18xmvwn,post
"'A City on Mars' is brilliant, much to the annoyance of space settlement boosters","I imagine this sub is familiar with the new book ""A City on Mars"" by  Kelly and Zach Weinersmith (the latter best known for the brilliant Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal comic). But if you're not: Read it. 

They make a detailed, intelligent and funny case for slowing down efforts to settle space, diving deep into biology (including poop and sex, as you might expect from SMBC) and technology and space geography and - this is what's most unusual - law and politics. 

The book makes a very convincing argument that not only are Musk-type space settlement dreams unrealistic to the point of delusional, they risk inflaming country-vs-country tension, which we definitely don't need. It would be better for all to proceed slowly and cautiously, as a global group, just as we have done with Antarctica and the seabed.

General Predictions for the Next 10 Years of Crewed Space Exploration,"Is it futile to try and attach dates to the historic human spaceflight achievements ahead? Of course, but we do it anyway, because its fun to theorize, and we know that humanity is not just at the dawn of a second space race, but at the beginning of a spacefaring future. In light of this, here are some general predictions for the future of crewed spaceflight. Some robotic missions are included for context.

Q2/3 2024: Polaris Dawn launches, marking the first ever commercial EVA.

Q1/2 2025: Artemis II launches, its the first time humans leave Earth's orbit in 51 years.

Q3/4 2025: Second Polaris mission launches, possibly involves boosting Hubble.

Q3/4 2025: India launches its first crewed spaceflight.

2026: Crewed operations on the ISS begin to scale down, with the USA and its allies gradually moving to commercial space stations and Russia moving to the Chinese Tiangong and trying to develop its own space station.

2026: Third Polaris mission launches, first ever crewed Starship launch.

2026: Vast's Haven-1 is launched into orbit via Falcon Heavy, becoming the first ever commercial crewed space station.

2026: Lunar Gateway enters Lunar orbit, its the first ever permanent interplanetary habitat.

2026: Blue Origin launches ESCAPADE to orbit Mars via New Glenn, Relativity Space launches Impulse Space's commercial mission via Terran R, SpaceX launches the first ever Starship to land on Mars. They all arrive in 2027 signifying the beginning of a commercial presence on Mars.

2027: Axiom Station detaches from the ISS.

2027: MZ's dearMoon lunar flyby mission launches via Starship the first commercial astronauts to leave Earth's orbit.

2027: Artemis III lands the first humans on the Moon for the first time in 55 years at the south pole via Starship HLS.

2028: Dennis Tito's lunar flyby occurs.

2028: The Nanoracks space station Starlab is launched into orbit.

2029: SpaceX launches a Starship to Mars carrying cargo critical to a future crewed mission

2029: Artemis IV lands humans on the Moon again via Starship HLS, at this point Artemis missions start to occur at a yearly cadence with that launch cadence continuously getting faster. In this year the final module of the Lunar Gateway is delivered and the foundations of a permanent base on the surface also begin to develop.

2031: The first crewed mission to Mars is launched via Starship to Arcadia Planitia, the crew is a mix of NASA and international astronauts as well as private individuals, they spend the full 26 months on Mars and then are mostly or entirely rotated.

2031: China launches its first crewed mission to the Moon, likely involving Russia and other international partners, creating the foundations for a permanent base.

2031: ISS has been fully decommissioned at this point and is deorbited into the South Pacific.

2033: A second crewed Starship is sent to Mars with a \~2x larger amount of people than the previous one, a number of whom are private individuals who intend to stay indefinitely.",space,1704213526.0,t3_18wtn2d,post

How SpaceX Will NOT Land On Mars,"[The Space Race just uploaded this video](https://youtu.be/pUK0KIZAa9E?si=7VB46JjO4nVq6Z4d).

I love that the video is extremely positive towards Starship and getting humans to Mars. It is also the first ""popular"" video I´m aware of which gets the negative lift approach and the belly flop right.

However one major part of the video is completely wrong.

Starship will ***not*** slow down via its engines prior to hitting the martian atmosphere for aerobraking. It will hit the atmosphere at interplanetary velocity.

The erroneous idea that spacecraft *intended to land* on Mars have to slow down before aerobraking has emerged on the internet in the recent months. And I don't know why.

All the rovers NASA has send to Mars in the last 20 years didn't slow down before aerobraking. They slammed into the atmosphere and used their heat shields to slow down until they were slow enough to deploy parachutes or execute their landing burns.

.

This post is intended to clear up this misconception and maybe generate a bit of publicity for how EDL (entry decent landing) actually works for spacecraft.",space,1704192472.0,t3_18wmnwk,post

Thoughts on using a multiple armies  of genetically modified or selective breed bacteria’s, nematodes, fungi, protozoa etc to terraform mars?

I’d imagine it would get complex for example we’ll need mixes of specific armies to create a small ecological reactions in the hopes to overlay them with other reactions to jump start parts of a ecological subsystem or w,e, for example just to create or retain moister at a certain depth for a certain amount of time or something ridiculous like that.

&#x200B;

>Way back in 1963, Roy Kerr became the first person to write down the exact solution, in general relativity, for a realistic, rotating black hole. 60 years later, it's still used everywhere. Although Roger Penrose won the Nobel Prize in physics just a few years ago for demonstrating how black holes come to exist in our Universe, singularities and all, the subject isn't closed. We've never peered beneath the event horizon, and have no way of detecting what's inside. Using a powerful mathematical argument, Kerr argues that singularities shouldn't physically exist.

Navigating the Night Sky for January 2024,"NAVIGATING THE NIGHT SKY for JANUARY 2024:
PLANET PLACEMENT and MOON MOTION
Make sure you take a moment to appreciate the beauty of the January sky, which more than meets the definition ""star-studded.""
🌖 (♌︎) Jan 1: in Leo the Lion, the bright star Regulus appears to the right of the waning gibbous Moon.
🌠  The Quadrantid meteor shower peaks overnight of Jan 2-3. This is one of the better meteor showers of the year, with 110 meteors per hour if skies are clear and often produces a number of bright meteors called fireballs. But this year moonlight interferes. The source of the Quadrantids is thought to be the asteroid 2003 EH1, which might actually be an extinct comet. This meteor stream gets its name because the meteors appear to radiate out from four stars near the constellation Boötes, which includes the bright star Arcturus, just after the handle of the Big Dipper. 
☀️ Jan 3: Earth at closest to Sun (perihelion). The Sun-Earth distance is 147.1 million kms.

It's been a long journey but the launch is finally here!

On 8th Jan 2024 at 7:18am GMT (2:18 EST) the Astrobotic lunar lander, [Peregrine](https://www.astrobotic.com/lunar-delivery/landers/peregrine-lander/), will launch from Space Launch Complex 41 on the East coast of Florida.

It will be launching on the maiden flight of Vulcan VC2S, by  United Launch Alliance.

Clarification on Hawking radiation,"I am trying to better understand how Hawking radiation works and would like the input of someone more familiar.

What I have read is that Hawking radiation is said to slowly erode the mass of a black hole over a very long time frame.

As I understand it, the basis for Hawking radiation is: pairs of virtual particles (particle A: matter-based, particle B: antimatter-based) are constantly being created and then annihilating each other. When this occurs near the event horizon of a black hole, the attractive force is so great that the closer particle to the black hole (let’s say A in this example) gets sucked in while the second particle B does not, leading to a constant stream of particles B being radiated from the black hole. 

What I don’t understand is this: given that particle A has entered the black hole, its mass is now higher than it was before the virtual particles were created. So even though the particles B would indeed cause Hawking radiation, they would actually lead to the black hole slowly growing larger, not smaller.

Can someone help me understand what I am missing here?",space,1703906628.0,t3_18u5nhc,post

So for a while now I know we can determine the age of the universe because of the red shift of distant galaxies. 

I also know that the universe is expanding and has been since the big bang. 

But how did we determine that those distant galaxies are 13.8 billion years old? We see them with a light delay of 13.8 billion years. Which, in my understanding, means they were where we see them 13.8 billion years ago. But the universe wasn't that big in the early days right?

Looking for carbon in and under craters on the Moon,"Based on existing lunar samples (and spectroscopy), we believe there isn't much carbon on the lunar surface. However, I don't think existing lunar samples were taken in or under big craters.  

Given our need for carbon-based compounds for life, agriculture, and most rocket fuels, this carbon deficiency would limit how fast we could develop sustainable outposts on the Moon (having to import carbon compounds to grow, even with extensive recycling).  But, the Moon is full of craters, and those craters were caused by meteors.  Assuming many of those meteors were similar in composition to asteroids, roughly 75% of them were ""carbonacious"", meaning carbon-bearing.  So, perhaps to find more carbon, we need to look harder into craters and underneath them. 

By analogy, rarer metallic meteors have crashed into Earth. The Sudbury, Ontario mine is because of a metallic meteor, and it's supplied metals for 120 years.  It goes deep, because the impact caused melting, but the metals are there. 

So the questions are, have people considered mining for carbon on the Moon?  Is anyone planning on looking for it?",space,1703730796.0,t3_18siq24,post

My grandfather passed away several years ago and my grandmother loves to talk about his accomplishments and look at his pictures. 

She was telling me earlier how my grandfather, while in the military, worked with wernher von braun on Explorer 1 and that she used to have a photo of both of them (as well as others who worked on it I believe) standing in front of the satellite and how she would love to see that picture again but it’s been lost for a long time.

The photograph would have been taken in 1958 and my grandmother said they were all in coveralls.

I was hoping maybe someone would have a copy of that photograph and I could gift it to her! 😊

Planetary Scientists - Venus temperature uniformity.,"Background, I'm a satellite ops guy and former Industrial Chemist.

While playing Terraforming Mars tonight I was looking at my Venus Next cards and thought, I wonder if Venus' surface temperature is different at the poles, lower angle of light etc. But then thought about the terminator atmospheric pressure wave we experience about an hour after dawn, that would create some fierce winds on Venus.

So I looked it up from ESA. [https://www.esa.int/ESA\_Multimedia/Images/2009/07/The\_new\_temperature\_map\_of\_Venus\_southern\_hemisphere](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2009/07/The_new_temperature_map_of_Venus_southern_hemisphere) from 2006/7 by VIRTIS on Venus Express.

[https://www.esa.int/ESA\_Multimedia/Images/2006/12/Temperature\_maps\_of\_Venus\_surface](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2006/12/Temperature_maps_of_Venus_surface)

Wow, its remarkably homogenous, twenty degrees variance across the planet.

First I want to ask, **why is it so uniform?** How can day and night and the solar irradiance angle at the poles make such little impact, noting the thickness of the atmosphere makes such a different by latitude on Earth. Does the atmosphere have that much of an averaging effect?

But then. **Why is it not more uniform?** If day/night heating cycle is averaged out by the atmosphere; what would cause this planet wide windy oven to have hot and cold spots if its had such a long time to erode and even out?",space,1703501625.0,t3_18qghkf,post

What are some good books to learn how the International Space Station works?,"There are many interesting videos about the ISS on YouTube, but I have a hard time committing video content to memory, and it is also difficult for me to create a mental picture of how things work in that format. 

So, what are some good books (or maybe long-form articles) about the ISS that can help me understand it both functionally and spatially? Essentially, where everything is, what everything is for, and also how all the procedures actually work. I'm looking for both accessible introductions for the general public and more technical literature (although I am not in STEM, so something meant specifically for engineers might be too much for me). 

The purpose of the request is research for something I am writing. I intend it to be (kinda hard) science fiction, so I wanna be able to comfortably visualize and refer to all the spaces and moving parts with knowledge. I do wanna learn some jargon and what it's for, but I'm not building a space station in my garage :P

It takes place in current times. 

I'm not against learning more about the history of the ISS, but my focus is really on how it is organized, what every part is meant to accomplish, and how the operations and procedures actually take place there. Including all the rules, methods, and inner works involving human beings, both in relation to the ISS and themselves.",space,1703239056.0,t3_18obggx,post

1/ **New Shepard Completes Successful Suborbital Flight**

Blue Origin's New Shepard suborbital vehicle returned to flight with a successful launch from West Texas on December 19. The mission, after overcoming technical and weather-related delays, carried 33 payloads and 38,000 postcards from Club for the Future. After achieving a peak altitude of 107 kilometers, the capsule and propulsion module landed successfully, marking the vehicle's first mission since an incident 15 months ago.

2/ **Peregrine Lunar Lander Set for January Launch**

Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander is set for an early January launch, aiming for a late February moon landing. Integrated with United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur rocket, Peregrine has completed pre-launch activities. Initially scheduled for December, the mission was postponed to January 8 due to technical issues. Peregrine will carry 20 payloads, including five from NASA's CLPS program and various commercial and memorial payloads.

3/ **Lynk Global Announces Plans to go Public**

Lynk Global intends to go public on Nasdaq by merging with Slam Corp, a SPAC led by Alex Rodriguez. This merger, valued at $800 million, will fund Lynk's expansion of its direct-to-smartphone satellite constellation. Lynk, currently offering intermittent texting services in select regions, plans to launch two more satellites on SpaceX's Falcon 9 for improved coverage. Their goal is to deploy 5,000 satellites for continuous global connectivity.

4/ **UK’s First Vertical Launch Spaceport Receives License**

The UK Civil Aviation Authority licensed SaxaVord Spaceport in the Shetland Islands as the UK's first vertical launch spaceport. With permission for 30 annual launches, SaxaVord is poised to host rockets from companies like ABL Space Systems and Skyrora. The timing of the first launch remains uncertain, with ABL preparing for a launch in support of Lockheed Martin's UK Pathfinder mission.

5/ **Electron Returns with Successful Launch**

Rocket Lab's Electron rocket successfully returned to flight, deploying a Japanese radar imaging satellite into orbit. The December 14 launch, following a failure in September, saw improvements in testing and pressurizing techniques to address previous issues. Electron has exceeded its annual launch record with ten flights this year, including the suborbital HASTE mission.

Bonus/ **China Conducts Third Launch of Secretive Reusable Spaceplane**

China conducted a third launch of its secretive reusable spacecraft on December 14. Launched by a Long March 2F rocket, the spacecraft entered a low Earth orbit. The rapid succession of launches suggests advancements in spacecraft reusability by developer CASC. Details of the spacecraft and its missions remain undisclosed, though its capabilities are compared to the US Air Force's X-37B spaceplane.

We could take over Vesta," Ive always found it interesting that a lot of asteroids are made mostly of peroskovites and olivine minerals, which funnily enough are very good materials for making of solar cells. I wonder if we could just wrap Vesta around with several huge rail like tracks and maybe even big, hundreds of meters apart netting, so when it spins, as it does, temperature difference between sunny and the dark side would make electricity in the peroskovite lines and tracks. And also glow. I thought that would be nice.

And then we could maybe stabilize its spin bit by bit. Make some nice rooms inside. Settle in. :)

edit: - The spin we would need does not have to create full 1G on the inside. If we had some spaces, ""rooms"" inside right now, the spin as it is would already create some amount of centrifugal force, i.e. ""gravity"".  Which would be helpful, for a start.
The question is how much of ""gravity"" pull such structures positioned under Vesta equator would create right now - and consequently how much would we need to adjust its spin, if at all - to get some amount of low G.

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vesta_Rotation.gif#/media/File:Vesta_Rotation.gif

If the rooms were of toroid shape, basically dug like tunnels under its ""equatorial"" axis, once we could manage to adjust Vestas spin, maybe we could set it so that those tunnels experience some amount of ""gravity"" force on the inside surface. (space odisey running track but much, much larger, with rooms and spaces of all sizes along inside outer wall surfaces)
 Vesta is kind of just about the right size to be interesting but just manageable for a bit bigger and long lasting base. 525 km mean diameter. A bit of egg looking, or a melon shaped. Roundish. Rotates around in about 5 hours. Thats pretty quick.

 *Vesta's surface area is about the same as the land area of Pakistan, Venezuela, Tanzania, or Nigeria; slightly under 900,000 square kilometers.

 *Temperatures on the surface have been estimated to lie between about −20 °C (253 K) with the Sun overhead, dropping to about −190 °C (83.1 K) at the winter pole. Typical daytime and nighttime temperatures are −60 °C (213 K) and −130 °C (143 K), respectively.

 *Vesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron–nickel core 214–226 km in diameter, an overlying rocky olivine mantle, with a surface crust.""

It would be interesting if someone could maybe calculate what we would need, for how long to adjust its spin even a little :P, and how wide would the tunnels need to be apart to get some amount of G feel inside, if spin was x speed on the same equatorial plane. 

Could we just build huge Ion thrusters and use all that electricity, with gas extracted or made inside? Or, we can always go nuclear if we need to.

Its seems like an interesting option to me.",space,1702510355.0,t3_18hukg4,post

You are a member of a space crew originally scheduled to rendezvous with a mother ship on the lighted surface of the moon. However, due to mechanical difficulties, your ship was forced to land at a spot some 200 miles from the rendezvous point. During reentry and landing, much of the equipment aboard was damaged and, since survival depends on reaching the mother ship, the most critical items available must be chosen for the 200-mile trip. Below are listed the 15 items left intact and undamaged after landing. Your task is to rank order them in terms of their importance for your crew in allowing them to reach the rendezvous point. Place the number 1 by the most important item, the number 2 by the second most important, and so on through number 15 for the least important.

* A box of matches
* Food concentrate
* 50 meters of nylon rope
* A silk parachute
* A portable heater powered by solar energy
* 2 caliber 45 pistols
* One case of dehydrated milk
* 2 oxygen tanks of 50 kg each
* A celestial map of lunar constellations
* An inflatable lifeboat
* A mangetic compass
* 25 liters of water
* A medical kit and hypodermic syringes
* Light signals
* A transceiver powered by solar energy (medium frequency)

&#x200B;

NASA answers:

&#x200B;

|A box of matches|Virtually worthless -- there's no oxygen on the moon to sustain combustion|15|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Food concentrate|Efficient means of supplying energy requirements|4|
|50 meters of nylon rope|Useful in scaling cliffs and tying injured together|6|
|A silk parachute|Protection from the sun's rays|8|
|A portable heater powered by solar energy|Not needed unless on the dark side (in our exercise :   ""No use: the suits are heated."")|13|
|2 caliber 45 pistols|Can be used to accelerate propulsion; at a stretch to end one’s days.|11|
|One case of dehydrated milk|Bulkier duplication of food concentrate|12|
|2 oxygen tanks of 50 kg each|Most pressing survival need (weight is not a factor since gravity is one-sixth of the Earth's -- each tank would weigh only about 17 lbs. on the moon)|1|
|A celestial map of lunar constellations|Primary means of navigation - star patterns appear essentially identical on the moon as on Earth|3|
|An inflatable lifeboat|CO2 bottle in military raft may be used for propulsion|9|
|A Magnetic compass|The magnetic field on the moon is not polarized, so it's worthless for navigation|14|
|25 liters of water|Needed for replacement of tremendous liquid loss on the light side|2|
|A medical kit and hypodermic syringes|Needles connected to vials of vitamins, medicines, etc. will fit special aperture in NASA space suit|7|
|Light signals|Use as distress signal when the mother ship is sighted|10|
|A transceiver powered by solar energy (medium frequency)|For communication with mother ship (but FM requires line-of-sight transmission and can only be used over short ranges)|5|

What if Mars One actually succeeded,"Remember Mars One? In case you don't, here's the TL;DR. Mars One was founded in 2012 based on the premise of selecting civilians to be the first Martian colonists. A group of over 200,000 people expressed interest in joining, which led to about 4,000 actually apply, and a group of 100 people being selected making the final cut. Mars One planned on selecting 24 people from that group of 100 to be the colonists to be sent to Mars starting in 2024, and to fund their colonization efforts with revenue generated from a Mars-based reality TV show, but ultimately they lacked the funding to progress further and ultimately declared bankruptcy.

Success for Mars One was always unlikely, very unlikely, but hypothetically, what if they actually succeeded? What if somehow, all their plans became reality and they started colonizing Mars in 2024? What do you think that would've looked like?",space,1702412824.0,t3_18gvhpy,post

Electric Vehicle Range on Mars,"
I've been wondering about how one would get the range of a Mars surface EV (adapted to the environment i.e. assumes higher wheel base, assumed radiation protection, etc). I cannot seem to find a way to calculate this, or even get a rough estimate. No calculator I've found even had gravity as a variable. What I tried doing was using this calculator:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15nEPJ7dn3G_eDHvyuuE_otKaGGGC6_KIABotgWXr_ls/edit#gid=1125318207

(If you don't like that link, here's where it's from: https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/11sa16f/ev_range_calculator/)

I tried entering a gravity adjusted number as the vehicle weight, but this still assumes many Earth gravity laden characteristics, like rolling resistance, drag, etc. Not to mention that the weight to power ratio would improve drastically as the batteries don't have to work nearly as hard to move the same mass, the effect certainly isn't linear.

Essentially, I'm looking for a way to control for different EV range variables given different gravity amounts with basic assumptions that it's rad-hardened, flat ground with no slippage (like how Perseverance avoids dust traps), and does not need a human driving. Controls would be for: Battery mass, non-battery vehicle mass, total Kwh, range in km, and of course, gravity.

So have at it:

Battery Earth weight: 5165kg

Overall vehicle weight: 12,000kg

KWh: 800

Gravitational constant: 3.71ms2

Flat ground, 25 kmh, battery temp fully insulated from temperature change and stays at 20C.",space,1702385782.0,t3_18gl9i3,post

"Since Falcon 9 uses the same engine for second stage as on the booster, could they take one of the old engines and expend it on the second stage after modification? They would add an engine on the booster and use the oldest one. Especially since merlin lasts about 10 flights, works out perfectly.",,space,1702254604.0,t3_18fhs4r,post

Rocket lamp one year on,"Apparently I can only post on Sunday.

Figured I’d post again since it’s been a year since I posted this last, and I’ve moved it across the country since then and made some small modifications. Figured anyone who hadn’t seen it last time would appreciate it and maybe want to build their own.
When I originally built this, I put a cloud at the top to cover a display light, obviously the rockets never really launched in cloud cover, but i have grown to like it, and it reminds me of the time Apollo 12 got struck by lightning. 

When I originally built this, I put a cloud at the top to cover a display light, obviously the rockets never really launched in cloud cover, but i have grown to like it, and it reminds me of the time Apollo 12 got struck by lightning. Obviously this is simply my take on the rocket lamp idea, this was not my original idea and some may have done it differently.

I've wanted to build this for years. As a huge nasa nerd, the previous builds of this enticed me to have my own. When I originally looked into this, I thought I could just buy it.. boy, was i for sure wrong..
But all is well.. after a few years of having the set sealed, it finally came time for me to mod it and make my attempt at a Saturn V rocket launch with the Lego ideas set.
What do you all think? Any tips or ideas are appreciated.
UPDATE: there has been way more likes and comments than expected. Thank you all so much for telling me how great it is, and how much you like it.
Haven't ever crafted anything before and was trying to emulate a previous post I had seen on another sub, so l put the word attempt in because we are never kind to our own creations, and usually only see the flaws sometimes.
A lot of comments wanted to know the building process, and while I didn't take that many before photos as I wasn't sure how it would turn out, I can explain in detail. Here's the base that it's sitting on, a pipe with two pipe plates so it gives it a sturdy mount to sit on. I was able to run the cables for the lights down the pipe as well. https://imgur.com/
gallery/WNHTWV
As far as how I made the rocket exhaust: I placed a 16 foot length of LED light strip around the pipe and down at the base of the stand. I then placed cotton fill around the pipe and the base. Pulling apart as desired to create the texture of smoke. I held this all together with a fine white thread so that I could properly shape the cloud to be as realistic as I could.

The stand is an ikea Detolf with a puck led light at the top above the cloud. I took some time and ground off the shelf brackets on the display case with a dremel tool so that it would look cleaner on the sides with solid unobstructed pieces of glass.
This took a while and was quite loud, but worth it in my opinion. https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/detolf-
glass-door-cabinet-black-brown-10119206/
For extra stability I held down the base of the rocket with the same white thread, and ran some white thread through the top of the case and tied it around the launch escape system.",space,1702244935.0,t3_18fecoz,post

The 5 top space industry news stories of the week in under 2 minutes,"This is my 5th weekly roundup. Let me know if you like the format, and if you’ve got any improvement ideas.

1/ **Amazon to use SpaceX for Project Kuiper**

Marking a significant shift, Amazon has contracted SpaceX for three Falcon 9 launches for its Project Kuiper constellation from mid-2025. This decision follows a lawsuit suggesting Amazon previously overlooked SpaceX due to a Bezos-Musk rivalry, instead opting for launches with ULA, Arianespace, and Blue Origin. The move is seen as key for the 3,200+ satellite constellation project's success. [Link](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-project-kuiper-spacex-launch)

2/ **ESA Announces Mid-2024 for Ariane 6's Inaugural Launch**

The European Space Agency has scheduled the first launch of Ariane 6 for mid-2024, following successful core stage hot-fire tests. The launch window is set between June 15 and July 31, 2024, with further qualification reviews due in spring 2024. The maiden flight will carry small satellites, and a second launch, potentially by year-end, is planned to deploy the CSO-3 reconnaissance satellite for the French military. [Link](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/Ariane_6_joint_update_report_30_November_2023)

3/ **GAO Report Predicts Artemis 3 Moon Landing Delay to 2027**

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report suggests NASA's Artemis 3 crewed lunar landing is unlikely before 2027, citing delays in SpaceX's Human Landing System (HLS) and Axiom Space's new lunar spacesuits. Challenges include SpaceX's ambitious schedule and technical complexities, as well as Axiom's early-stage suit development, potentially impacted by supply chain issues. [Link](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106256)

4/ **Potential Cuts to NASA's 2024 Space Tech Budget**

NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) faces significant impacts from proposed 2024 budget cuts. With the Senate suggesting a 7% decrease, various programs could see up to 27% funding reductions. While some initiatives like OSAM-1 and small business programs are fully funded, the uncertainty has prompted NASA to adopt a conservative spending approach. [Link](https://spacenews.com/nasa-warns-of-very-problematic-space-technology-budget-cuts/)

5/ **Ursa Major Secures $138 Million in Series D Funding**

Ursa Major, a rocket propulsion startup, has raised $138 million in Series D and D-1 funding rounds. The Colorado-based company focuses on manufacturing liquid engines for small space launchers and hypersonic vehicles, with plans to venture into solid rocket motors. The funding will boost its new solid rocket motor program and support scaling production and technological advancements in its propulsion systems.

"Newest Smarter Every Day: Destin speaks at American Astronautical Society, gives opinion/doubts on Artemis.","Mods, giving this a go again with regard to your pm. Hope this is acceptable now?

I love reading the in depth and highly informed opinions and thoughts so many of you here have on things. If you make it through Destins entire video, I'm sure it's bound to have people pick a side, which is exactly what I believe he's speaking to in much of his speech. Some of it may be very personal to a lot of you here, as I'm sure there are men and women here from JSC, KSC, MSFC (Huntsvillian here myself), etc., but I'd really like to know and listen to what people that are far more informed on goals, capabilities, mission planning, budgets, especially the differences in those from Apollo vs Artemis. 

Just a nice, clean, civil discussion if that's OK? I love our manned space flight history, and fully support its future and all that the current agencies can do with the budget they're allowed. Could we have done better with the budget we have? Did we make the best decisions with SLS/Artemis? If not, how and what should our manned space flight pivot towards for the future? If we did do the best we could, how can we maintain that, and even garner more public support to build more political will to expand it and allow even more opportunities?

Should I switch from a Economics and Finance masters to the Space Field to follow my passion?,"Hi Everyone. My name is Jose I’m 27 years old and I’m facing one of the toughest decisions of my life. I need your help and opinions.

Background. I was born in Venezuela and moved to Panama when I was 15. I was good at math on my high school and I wanted to study something related to it. I’ve always had a huge passion for space, but both in Venezuela and Panama that seemed like an impossible task or was simply not available or no job market for it. I remember innumerable hours looking at the stars wondering about the universe, galaxies, etc. I also don’t come from a Wealthy Family. And so I studied Industrial Engineering, and got good grades. After that I worked as a Data Analyst for a tech company for about 3.5 years. I got decent skills in SQL, Tableau, although Python not much, I’ve always find programming a bit weird and complex for me, although I know in all of my liked fields is nearly essential. I think with hard studying and practice I can get better. But that’s not the point of this subject. After 3 and a half years of working as a Data Analyst, I wanted to make a big change in my life and do a Masters Degree, I started to wonder if I could do something related to space, but I just didn’t dare enough to look too much(thinking this is absurd, there are no jobs for that), I just looked at Astronomy and Astrophysics masters and all of them naturally required a huge level of knowledge in their own bachelor’s subjects. So I dropped that idea of my mind, and looked for something I could be good at, and so I decided to go for a masters in Economics and Finance. I did all the paperwork and moved to south of Germany and started to study the masters. Just before I moved, like a week before I saw this movie called a Million Miles Away, about a Latin boy that faced all odds and became an Astronaut. That hit me so hard, and I started to have second doubts about what I was doing with my life, wondering whether I truly wanted to study Economics and Finance. But then I thought to myself, this is just a movie, it’s dumb you are thinking this, just go back to what you are going for, there is no turning back I thought. So I’m here in Germany right now studying Econ and Finance for about 2 months. And I got to tell you, is not really that fun, I’m trying to picture myself working for a bank, or looking at spreadsheets, and the finance department, and just economical numbers and theories, and that no longer seems to me as something I would like to do, as if I would be too bored and would hate my job in the future, even if I get good money. But I kept telling myself in the last 2 months, it’s ok, you might find a fun job eventually, or be the financial analyst for a space agency or something like that, but that still involved being on finance naturally. And I also told myself no, it’s too late to switch. And maybe just maybe a company like a space agency will consider me more for an engineer role, but that still seemed like a loss for me of studying economics for 2-3 years, might as well switch to an engineer field again.

Anyways, I met this new guy, close to a new friend of me here in Germany, who is an aerospace engineer and works in a satellite company for geological space studies of wheather and so on. And I thought to myself, damn that’s so cool, he made it. And he told me then than there are some job possibilities but mainly they look for engineers, as most of the related companies. And so I started to wonder, how about if I switch my masters to something related to that, some of the options I’m facing are Space Science and Technology, or Aerospace Science and Technology, Aeronautic Engineer, some have a Major in Space (not all). But I, in principle do have the option and credentials to switch for this new field. I would have to drop out of my current program, that obviously is something very scary, and I’m alone in Germany (no family) with a Visa that was supposed to last at least a year. And these masters options are in different parts of Europe, for instance Spain, Austria, or even Germany. However except for 1 or 2, most begin on the winter semester (September 2024) and we are not at all close to it, I will apply to the ones that begin in March 2024, but there is no guarantees I will get in. In the case I don’t get accepted to the ones beginning in March, what would my best options be? Go home and regroup(I could save some money, since I’m self funding all of this)? Try to get some credits out of my current program? Get a job whilst studying? My masters will kick me out on 2 semesters if I don’t have at least 30 ECTS (credit points). 

And then there is the fact of whether I can actually go well on a space related program and career, I first thought that seems I was good with finance that would be the best field for me. I was kind of scared of moving to space fields thinking might be too hard. And I did had my struggles on industrial Engineering in subjects such as Physics, Electricity and Chemistry, although it’s not like they were impossible, I just struggled, I was better at math. And I’m just wondering, is this really a good choice for me? Or a huge crisis I’m going through? Maybe I’m so scared thinking what would my life look like in 3-5 years, in a boring finance job.

My ideal job would obviously be working a company such as NASA or ESA, and or working in observatories, analyzing data, making operations and processes smoother and more efficient, optimization, planetary simulations, looking at stars, etc. It would truly be a dream come true. 

Im also planning naturally, to look for more opinions from family members, friends, advisors if possible, etc. But I thought hey, why not talk to people involved in this field. 

What options, ideas, recommendations, tips, warnings, should I have before doing such a thing?

Using small scale spacecraft with solar sails to explore the solar system,"According to the article,  https://phys.org/news/2024-01-qa-small-solar-giant-interplanetary.html, ""Nearly 70 years after the launch of the first satellite, we still have more questions than answers about space. But a team of Berkeley researchers is on a mission to change this with a proposal to build a fleet of low-cost, autonomous spacecraft, each weighing only 10 grams and propelled by nothing more than the pressure of solar radiation. These miniaturized solar sails could potentially visit thousands of near-Earth asteroids and comets, capturing high-resolution images and collecting samples.""

My comments. Before sending star sails or laser sails to nearby stars, it is a good idea to start small, with spacecraft that rely on cheap existing consumer technology (along with solar sails, and other specialized technology developed for the spacecraft), possibly adapted or improved for the space environment, and resistant to space hazards. With a low budget in time and cost, numerous small spacecraft can be launched, in one go, and at least some of them should succeed in meeting mission objectives, like surveying comets and asteroids.",space,1705748422.0,t3_19b9d30,post

&#x200B;

\[Congressperson's Full Name\]

\[Office Address\]

\[City, State, ZIP Code\]

Dear \[Senator/Representative\] \[Congressperson's Last Name\],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deep concern and strong opposition to the proposed budget cuts to NASA in the Fiscal Year 2024 budget. As a constituent who is passionate about space exploration and the invaluable contributions that NASA makes to our nation, I believe that these cuts would have detrimental effects on both our scientific progress and technological advancements.

NASA plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the universe, driving innovation, and inspiring the next generation of scientists, engineers, and explorers. The proposed budget cuts would jeopardize ongoing missions, delay planned launches, and undermine the agency's ability to pursue ambitious projects critical to our nation's leadership in space exploration.

Recent studies on the Return on Investment (ROI) of NASA's missions, such as the 2017 NASA Economic Impact Report and the 2013 report by the Tauri Group, highlight the significant economic and technological benefits derived from space exploration. The direct and indirect impacts of NASA's work contribute to job creation, technological advancements, and economic growth. Cutting the budget would not only curtail these positive outcomes but also hinder our nation's ability to harness the full potential of space-related industries.

Specifically, I would like to draw attention to the Mars Sample Return mission, a cornerstone in NASA's exploration strategy. This mission is poised to provide groundbreaking insights into the Martian environment and the potential for past life on the red planet. The scientific and technological advancements resulting from this mission have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos and stimulate innovation in fields ranging from robotics to astrobiology.

The proposed budget cuts would not only jeopardize the success of the Mars Sample Return mission but also hinder the development of critical technologies that could have widespread applications beyond space exploration.

I urge you to use your influence to advocate for the preservation of NASA's budget and to work towards securing the necessary funding to ensure the continuity of vital programs and missions, such as the Mars Sample Return mission. Investing in NASA is an investment in our economy and the future of our nation, and I believe that supporting the agency's work is essential for the long-term success and prosperity of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the importance of NASA's mission, the demonstrated ROI, and the positive impact it has on our country. I appreciate your dedication to serving our community and look forward to hearing about your efforts to protect NASA's funding.

Sincerely,

\[Your Full Name\]

Huge water deposit suspected at Mars equator.,"Mars’s Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) consists of a series of wind-sculpted deposits measuring hundreds of kilometres across and several kilometres high. Found at the boundary between Mars’s highlands and lowlands, the features are possibly the biggest single source of dust on Mars, and one of the most extensive deposits on the planet.

But this dry layer seems to hide a secret. A team of researchers used Mars Express radar data to peer below the surface. What they found was a top layer of dust that covers what seems to be a thick layer of deposits rich in water ice. This map shows the estimated amount of ice within the mounds that form the MFF, indicating that the ice-rich deposits are up to 3000 m thick.

The researchers estimate that the layer of dry material (likely dust or volcanic ash) covering the ice is 300–600 m thick. This map shows the ice thickness if we assume that the dust is 300 m thick. In this case, the total volume of water ice contained within the MFF deposits would be 400 000 km3, or if it melted, enough to cover Mars in an ocean of water 2.7 m deep.

If the dust layer is instead 600 m thick, the water ice layer would be thinner, and the total volume of water ice contained within the MFF deposits would be 220 000 km3, or if it melted, enough to cover Mars in an ocean of water 1.5 m deep.

Designing a coffee cup for Mars,"I am working on a product for a design firm looking to develop drinking vessels for Mars.  
Scientists developed cups with capillary action for weightlessness in Space, INSS, for instance. And they use them for drinking as an alternative to sipping out of bags of liquids (Don Roy Pettit). I have included photos connected to his team's design. 

But there is gravity on Mars. From Google snippets: ""Since Mars has less mass than Earth, the surface gravity on Mars is less than the surface gravity on Earth. The surface gravity on Mars is only about 38% of the surface gravity on Earth, so if you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh only 38 pounds on Mars.""

My question is how would that 38% affect capillary action? Could regular drinking cups as we use on earth be used on Mars or should we modify them in case they slip from our hand or don't sit as evenly on a table. Let's say the liquid inside is wine, water or coffee.

where to find a gallery or galleries of (preferably) high res images of space from NASA?,"I've been looking all over NASA's site, and Google in general, and I just can't seem to find such a gallery for the life of me. I'm really hoping somebody here can point me to some good galleries. It doesn't even have to be NASA. But, I always see such beautiful images on YouTube channels like Scott Manley, for example, and would love to find entire galleries of such images.

You would expect that NASA would have a photo gallery of such images, but when I look up the photo gallery on NASA's site, it's pictures of everything BUT space. People standing at a lecturn at some press conference, some people outside, some people working at a desk, some more people at a desk, and so on. 

Not exactly the sort of thing anyone would expect from a NASA photo gallery. It was more like a PR page than anything.

As for searching Google, all I got was a lot of pages of computer generated stock photos of space. Even specifically searching for satellite images, and using a -stock operator, Google just does what it wants to do.

RE Venus Express Findings,"Hi this is a question about the implications of Venus Express findings.

(Since I don't know an expression that works for my question, please excuse my misuse /retooling of the expression, Goldilocks zone.)

I'm looking at a report 19th April 2016 titled 'Venus Express' Swansong Experiment Sheds Light on Venus Polar Atmosphere'. 

My question is this: given our previous knowledge of Venus' atmosphere was based on equatorial observations via 1970s Pioneer findings (which put it at searing 400 degrees Celsius) and given we now know the polar regions possess temperatures of minus 157 degrees Celsius, do we have any other information precluding the possibility that there exists a high latitude (not altitude, Im interested in surface temperatures) / local 'Goldilocks zone' where the temperature is.. hmm..

When the Sun Vanished,"1500 years ago, a darkness unlike any other. The Sun, our lifeblood, vanished, plunging the world into an icy abyss. For an extended period of time, humanity clung to flickering fires, whispers of a lost sun, and the chilling legend of... The Sunless Age.

In this week’s Cosmicode article, we try to decode the secrets of the A.D. 536 catastrophe. What caused the Sun to vanish?

Black Holes and their interaction with Dark Matter,"Here's a Dark Matter topic I've never seen discussed and am curious about.

So given the assumption that we're talking about classical WIMPs, then Dark Matter is highly abundant and does not interact electromagnetically with the rest of the universe (or itself).

Given that it essentially has no friction, It won't ever form stars or planets or similarly dense clumps - just discs, halos, clouds, maybe filaments on the large scale - so far so good.

However its interaction with black holes is different, DM *would* interact with the Event Horizon normally (for some version of the world 'normal'), as it is a purely gravitational phenomenon, and DM *does* obey gravity. This means that Dark Matter CAN densely clump in the form of black holes - it wouldn't form them itself, but it'd certainly get sucked into existing ones, never to emerge.

So how much faster should this dense background of Dark Matter feed black holes vs. normal matter?

On the side suggesting they'd feed faster, DM would never be pushed away from the BH by the radiation pressure of an active accretion disk, allowing it to fall in at a rate unrestricted by the amount of other DM in the region - unlike normal matter, which imposes its own feeding limit of sorts.

On the side suggesting they'd feed slower on DM, it would suffer little or no loss of energy from interaction with other particles around the black hole, and thus presumably tend to slingshot clean past \*without\* being drawn into an accretion disk or decaying orbit - only DM on a fairly direct trajectory would be likely to interact with the Event Horizon.

Has any study examined these factors and determined what effect this huge amount of Dark Matter should have on the *growth rate* of various classes of black hole, given our current assumptions about its density in galaxies? Has this been compared against the apparent growth rate of supermassive black holes, where we can glean some record of their evolution since the BB? Do these assumptions line up at all?",space,1706460760.0,t3_1ad70ia,post

Question about relativity and the twin paradox in a non stationary universe,"I've always had thoughts in my head rattling around about relativity and things moving through space at different speeds in conjunction with expanding space from inflation / the expanding universe.

I'm also trying to grapple with the concept that, from my understanding, there is no such thing as a true stationary point in space in an expanding universe; as how could one plot fixed distance coordinates in a volume of space that is always expanding. I do understand that inflation doesn't really affect things at a local scale, for example within our galaxy so this may not pertain to the following question quite so much but it's all in my head and it's all coming out right now so bear with me if you have the patience!

&#x200B;

So here is the question... From what I understand about the twin paradox - two identical twins exist, exactly the same biological age, if twin A stays on earth and twin B goes off in a space ship and flies around at a 'pretty fast' speed for a good chunk of time, twin B will come back biologically younger than twin A. And if twin B took an atomic clock on board with him that would support that time has passed slightly slower for him than twin A. It may be billionths of a second unless the speed travelled by twin B was getting close to the speed of light but it is a real and measurable thing.

I'm fully on board with that, crazy as it is, so that's all good. But... if we take into account that the milky way is apparently moving through space at a velocity of 600km per second according to wikipedia, and that rough figure seems to be supported by other websites:

>*"" The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km  per second (372 miles per second) with respect to extragalactic frames  of reference ""*

Then I get a bit confused as to how that surley must affect the outcome of that experiment. So to keep things simple lets ignore expanding space for now and assume there is no inflation. If we are travelling though space at those speeds on earth, and those speeds are relative to being 'cosmically stationary', would it not make a huge difference what direction the space ship with twin B travelled in?

Let's say the milky way and therefore earth is travelling in the positive X direction:

* If twin B takes off from earth also in positive X then he is travelling at 600km/ps plus the speed of the space ship (relative to a cosmic stationary point) So would therefore be aging slower as the twin paradox tells us, as he is travelling closer to the speed of light.
* If twin B takes off from earth in *negative* X then he is travelling at 600km/ps minus the speed of the space ship (relative to a cosmic stationary point) so therefore would he not be travelling SLOWER than twin A on earth and therefore twin A would age slower...?

I know this is massively simplified but I think it gets my question across as it's kinda hard to explain, but hopefully that makes sense. I guess it's some what comparable to if someone shoots a gun from a moving train forward or backwards relative to a static observer on the ground.

I think I have got something mixed up somewhere in regards to my understanding of relativity. Am I wrong in assuming that things are measured from a reference frame of the 'cosmic stationary'?

If so then there must surley be some reference point to measure things against, otherwise (if you ignore the earth and the spaceship) according to each twin they are just moving away from the other twin relative to themselves. Or indeed you could say the other twin is just moving away from them and they are stationary.

Lots of babble and writing things as it came out of my head but hopefully there is a coherent question in there somewhere! Can anyone with a good grasp of relativity explain why the above is incorrect (Which I assume it is)?

BTW this is my first Reddit post so go easy one me

[X-Men] Is Mystique effectively immortal?,"Mystique's power is obviously shapeshifting, which seems very useful but not too OP- until you consider that almost any damage her body sustains can be shapeshifted away. Old age? Not possible when you can simply shapeshift your cells to be younger. Stab wounds or bullet holes? She could shapeshift and they are gone.

Obviously she can't tank massive damage like Wolverine or Deadpool, but is there any reason to believe that Mystique couldn't just shapeshift her cells to be indefinitely youthful and survive forever?

What kind of limits do her powers have? I know in the movie she lost focus (due to physical damage) and turned back into her blue form, so theoretically if that is true across all continuities then eventually losing focus would be fatal (due to old age). But does Mystique's base form age while she isn't using it?

[DC] I'm a film director and made a movie about Batman that strongly implies that Batman is Bruce Wayne. Will I get in any kind of trouble?,"I'm a film director who grew up in Gotham City who recently made a film about Batman. 

It's complete fiction as we don't know anything about who or what Batman is, but it's fun to speculate, right?

As a born and bred Gothamite, I've always figured that Batman is just a regular man, not a metahuman or a monster or alien or whatever, and is probably a rich person. All of my friends and family feel the same way.

The characterization for Batman in my movie is loosely based on Bruce Wayne, the famous billionaire. He's not called Bruce Wayne in the movie, and to protect myself legally, there's nothing about my protagonist that specifically ties him to Mr Wayne, but it's clearly based on around him. 

In fact, the impetus for my Batman character starting his career as a vigilante is based around an event inspired by Bruce Wayne's life. In the movie, the main character's parents are murdered by a mugger after a trip to the cinema when my protagonist is a little boy, and that incident and the trauma inspired by it causes my protagonist to train himself to become the best person he can possibly be in a relentless war on crime. 

Anyway, while legally I'm allowed to make this movie and am proud of the finished product, I am a bit concerned by repercussions from the real life Batman, his allies, or his villains. Do I have a reason to be worried?",AskScienceFiction,1705719422.0,t3_19b1ljm,post

That's a good difference. I know this example sounds way too simple.

But the idea of Wizards having external powers from via gods, different dimensions, etc. And the Mutants having internal powers based on their physicality. This sounds like a good way to differentiate both on the surface.

[Star Wars] Why did Kenobi pull his light sabre in the cantina instead of using a mind trick?,"In the 'creature cantina' of A New Hope, Kenobi draws his lightsaber and defends Luke from two unruly customers.

&#x200B;

We know from other sources and stories that Kenobi is one of the last of the Jedi, that he's hiding out, that he's been a virtual hermit for years, that the remaining Jedi are being hunted by the Empire. We can also surely assume that lightsabers are rare (Luke's never seen one, though Han seems to casually recognise it) and that they were always historically associated with the Jedi (Anakin recognises a 'laser sword' in TPM), so by producing it and wielding it so deftly, Kenobi is effectively outing himself as one of the very few remaining Jedi, in a hostile, Empire-dominated environment where information travels quickly, at a time when he is finally escorting the son of Anakin on a mission to save the daughter of Anakin -- it could hardly be higher stakes.

&#x200B;

So why doesn't he use a mind trick when he tells Evazan and 'Walrus Man' that this little one's not worth the effort... come, let me get you something?

&#x200B;

We've just seen him use it successfully on Stormtroopers. It would avoid any attention and importantly, conceal his own status as a Jedi. We know there are spies and informants around. We know this is a risky mission. Why does he take that extra risk?

&#x200B;

(My bonus no-prize possible answer: Kenobi knows this will be his last mission and that he'll die on the Death Star, so he has a sense of inner calm, has weighed up the risks and is taking them after calculation and reflection. He knows that he'll soon be facing Vader again for the final time, and he can afford to show Luke the power of a Jedi-wielded lightsaber, just as he showed him the effects of the Force on the weak-minded minutes earlier)",AskScienceFiction,1705662556.0,t3_19agp8u,post

[Eragon/Inheritance] How can the Ancient Language and true names bind someone who knows them?,"Like, when Galbatorix first subjugated Murtagh and Dorn by using their true names to make them swear unbreakable oaths, I could buy that he just didn't teach them any of it until it was already done (although it's questionable how a dragon swearing in the Ancient Language, which would be more like thinking than saying, would even work).

**(Spoilers for the latest book *Murtagh* ahead!)**

But why would your true name give a random stranger more power over you than if you know the name yourself?\* Or what if two people knowing your true name gave you conflicting orders? Do you have to obey whichever one came first?

Which brings me to the second point about unbreakable oaths:

If you know enough of the Ancient Language yourself, couldn't you just swear an unbreakable oath to never swear an unbreakable oath to one of your enemies or to a specific person you know may want to subjugate you this way, making any future attempt to do so a contradiction and therefore a lie?

If so, how could Bachel hope to subjugate Murtagh this way again, or rather why wouldn't Murtagh have thought to use this loophole to avoid it?

\* It should be noted that true names demonstrably *don't* work by just allowing you to inevitably pursue another person, because you know so much about them. It's really more like root rights in IT or ""Simon Says"".",AskScienceFiction,1705602677.0,t3_199x1id,post

[Eragon/Inheritance] What was the point of that Urgal massacre in Yazuac?,"Contrary to what the first book would make us (or Eragon) believe at that point, Urgals are neither inherently evil and cruel monsters nor mindless beasts. They're fighting and killing for prestige, to make a name for themselves, to honor their tribe, and also for land and resources they need to live.

They're also definitely capable of reasoning and empathy, and I'd think that fighting a worthy opponent fits them better than killing for killing's sake. I can't imagine that any Urgal would be particularly proud of having a story about them slaughtering a bunch of children or sticking an infant on a lance on their Namna.

So, why did they do this?

It was theorized by Eragon and Brom that the Ra'zac might have ordered it, but there doesn't seem to be much of a compelling reason why they should, and there were also no signs of any of the villagers having been eaten.

It was also mentioned to be unusual for Urgals to even come together in such numbers, at all, so maybe Durza could've rallied them for the later attack on Farthen Dûr, so they may just have pillaged the village on their way through and committed a war crime like any other not particularly disciplined army would.

Though Durza himself should've still been occupied by questioning Arya in Gil'ead at that time, and didn't the attack primarily happen, because Eragon had joined the Varden there? Which was only a speculation that he might, at that point.

[War of the Worlds] How did the aliens die of disease?,"I'm asking this because I haven't found any answers anywhere, and it's something that has been bothering for quite a while. How did the aliens die of diseases? Even if they are DNA and carbon-based lifeforms, our microorganisms, viruses and even prions shouldn't be able to infect them, at least not in such a short time.

The reason why there are new viruses or microbes infecting humans from time to time is because not only there are many of us, we are always in somewhat close contact to each other, which allows for quick dissemination of diseases, but these aliens aren't really that numerous, on the invasion, and they're not really close together.

And not only that, any infection that would affect them, would first need to - through random mutations - be able to infect them, and be contagious enough to spread among them, while not being too deadly, otherwise only a handful would get infected and would promptly die, killing the virus or infectious agent too.

So is seems, to me, like a very difficult scenario, because it relies on so many variables, it might as well be impossible. And I'm not even getting into other factors such as how advanced alien medical technology is, how different their physiology is from a human's or other Earth species. This way of defeating the aliens just seems very naive, to be completely honest. So I'd like to hear a different opinion on the matter.

Typically, my methodology for this sort of thing is comparing a long-lived characters physical age to real-world human physical ages. So if a character looks 60 and is 300 in-universe, clearly 300 is the equivalent to 60. However, as far as I know, there are very few characters in Warhammer 40k to have precisely dated lifespans and no art of them at various points in their life to help with this.

When he finds out about Person Y's death, stricken with grief, Person X goes to police and confesses he killed Y using the apparent Death Note.  He is not taken seriously by the police.

Overcome with guilt, he writes a note confessing to using the Death Note and commits suicide in a way that leaves little room for doubt that he committed suicide and he felt he was responsible for the Death of Person Y.

EDIT:

I just realized, person X doesn't need to actually kill Y, he just needs to believe he did.

Person Y

Heart Attack at time Z.

Person X

Person X finds what appears to be a Death Note. Thinking it's some sort of childish prank, he writes the name of Person Y at Time Z-40 seconds. When he finds out about Person Y's death, stricken with grief, Person X goes to police and confesses he killed Y using the apparent Death Note. He is not taken seriously by the police.

Overcome with guilt, he writes a note confessing to using the Death Note and commits suicide in a way that leaves little room for doubt that he committed suicide and he felt he was responsible for the Death of Person Y.",AskScienceFiction,1704856474.0,t3_192y4ie,post

[Animorphs] Could a person survive and be conscious for ~2 minutes with only one lung?,"There's a [discussion](https://www.tumblr.com/thejakeformerlyknownasprince/739079724906774528/how-do-you-think-morphing-technology-would-affect?source=share) going on Tumblr about how — since morphing in *Animorphs* lets you heal from any injury — you could use that to donate an infinite organs.  But it takes a minute or two to morph, and you have to be concentrating the whole time, so we do see morphers (e.g. >!Rachel!<) killed by catastrophic injury.

[Marvel] Can a telepath just transfer knowledge and become a super-genius?,"I was recently rereading New X-Men Vol 2 (2004) and became interested in Prodigy, He subconsciously copies all the knowledge and skills of those around him. He's limited by a subconscious mental block to only keep them temporarily but Emma Frost says she could remove it but he refuses as he is shown a nightmare by Dani Moonstar where he goes around meeting the world's geniuses like Stephen Hawking, Tony Stark and Reed Richards and becomes corrupted as the knowledge came to him too easily.

The character Agent X  from Deadpool Vol 3 (2002) accidentally absorbed the telepathic mercenary Black Swan's years of Marksmanship experience due to an accident.

Telepaths who have full-telepathy such as Professor Xavier and Emma Frost have been able to teach the X-Men languages for missions. The Stepford Cuckoo's psychically transferred all of Beasts' genius-level of understanding of human and mutant biology, anatomy, genetics etc.

I'm not sure where, but recently reading some old X-Men issues I read that Beast called himself in the top eight smartest people on Earth. He's definitely gone down with the inclusion of characters like Moon Girl, but regardless he is one of the smartest people on Earth. So would it be possible for a skilled telepath to copy all of the knowledge and skills of the Earth's smartest people like Tony Stark, Reed Richards, Pym, Cho etc. and become the smartest person on Earth?

Whilst I'm sure Psi-Blockers are fairly easy to get for these people, I doubt anyone other than Doom is paranoid enough to have one on them to stop their knowledge being stolen.",AskScienceFiction,1704834993.0,t3_192pvva,post
[Iron Man] Why did the US government disapprove of the sound paralyzation technology that Obadiah used?,"Obadiah mentioned that the US government disapproved of the tech and implying that they could not sell it as a product. I am curious why this would be? 

The sound paralyzation tech seems to be much more powerful than the Iron Man MK1 platform as it can instantaneously incapacitate large crowds of people without any damage to the infrastructure. I'm imagining small stealth drones equipped with the speaker just flying into a military base and KOing everyone. After that a single grunt could go in to mop up. This seems like just the thing every special ops team would love to have. Even outside of military use, the tech could put an end to many hostage, terrorist and riot scenarios.

Based on the footage of the movie, those who are paralyzed begin to bleed from the ears so it would be safe to assume that it would cause permanent or long term damage, thus disqualifying it as a non-lethal option for police. But even so, it would be such a good military tool. Especially if the goal is to capture someone alive.",AskScienceFiction,1704832923.0,t3_192p0oc,post

[Doctor Who] Paradox Timey-Wimey things.,"So I have been rewatching Doctor Who and there is a question that keeps nagging at me. 

I'll use my most recent episode as an example.

The Doctor lands and gets captured by Vikings, they take him to their village. Aliens come and abduct a bunch of them (those ones die) and where at this point apparently the alien would normally leave as is their M.O. but they end up staying and trying to wipe out the village.

In the end the doctor defeats them but in doing so has potentially caused a ""tidal wave"" in time. 

So was the doctors presence there always a thing or did he only become there after he went there? If that makes sense. 

Is the doctors involvement in any given alien invasion something that had always happened? 

Like apparently cos he is a time lord he can just see things that are/were supposed to be. So he knows what was a fixed event. The Pompeii episode. The family he saved. Was that family always have been saved and the Doctor was destined to save them. Or did he actually choose to?

"[Half Life] Why didn't our terrestrial flora, fauna and microflora kill of the Xen aliens and Combine?","As we saw in War Of The Worlds, microorganisms are silent killers and our invisible line of defense against intruders.

So how come that they didn't kill off the Xen aliens and Combine when they invaded Earth? After all, they don't have any immunity against all of our little bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi and while the reverse is true as well, our buggers have a much larger presence on Earth than their alien equivalents.

And with a lot of the aliens having large and unprotected orifices, like Headcrabs, Barnacles, Houndeyes or Ichthyosaurs, I don't see how those would not be free real estate for our microorganisms.

And something similar goes for our animals. Would a headcrab know that it is a bad idea trying to infect a grizzley bear? Would Bullsquids be able to protect themselves from wolf packs or lions? Would the Combine know that touching that harmless looking stinging nettle known as the Australian stinging bush or that cute little yellow octopus with the glowing blue rings is a very bad idea?

[DC] How far does Joker's hatred of Nazis go?,"

So in a crossover comic, Joker turns on Red Skull (who was teaming up with him) upon learning Red Skull is a Nazi. When doing so, he emphasizes that he is an **American** criminal lunatic, the obvious implication being that he cannot stand Nazism as it is too opposed ideologically to American beliefs. 

How far does this go? Would he be against working with an Imperial Japanese themed villain, or one from Fascist Italy? Would he turn on a villain themed around Al Qaeda or ISIS? Would he be against Soviet or Iranian villains?

[MCU] Does Allspeak come from the Space Stone?,"We know from Avengers Infinity War that Thor understands Allspeak, so it exists in the MCU.

We also know that Odin had the Space Stone in the Tesseract for some time before he sequestered it on Earth.

In What If...? we learn of Kahhori, who has powers from the Space Stone. She is able to learn Spanish and English remarkably quickly (off screen) and speak them quite well. It's possible that she learned Spanish normally, since there were two Spanish expeditions lost after Gonzolo's. Specifically, Queen Isabella's courtier says ""First Gonzolo, then Jacobo and the Mendoza brothers. None returned."" However, it seems unlikely that she would understand Doctor Strange's modern English when he arrives in the court, nor have a chance to learn it normally before talking with Peggy Carter in the finale.

This makes me wonder if she (and the others in the Sky World) has a form of Allspeak like the Asgardians? If so, that would mean that it comes from the Space Stone, and so Captain Marvel may have a form of Allspeak as well.

for wonder woman her old boyfriend comes back from the dead but inhabits the body of a random person.  to steve it was 1918 when he died in his self sacrifice.

fast forward 66 years into 1984 across time and space.  he's back.

she shows him around the modern world and steve is a fish out of water.

later on they had to get somewhere and the reason to steal a jet was because “Steve” did not have a passport and he would be able to fly with Diana across the Atlantic  
  
 now my question is .... how is steve able to fly a jet fighter in 1984 when his flying skills are limited to 1918 planes? i mean he'd be hard pressed to fly a WW2 plane much less a jet fighter from 1984? or if we want to be technical about it the plane is based on  F-111 Aardvark which first introduced in 1967. still 49 year gap in plane knowledge.

"[Across the Spider-Verse] If Miles “wasn’t supposed to” be Spider-Man, why didn’t Miguel just stop Miles’s original Spider-Man from dying?","Idk if this is the right place to post this, but I just watched the movie and am very confused about the logic of “canon events.” Apparently there are some things that have to happen and some things that can’t happen in order for individual universes to remain intact - for example, Uncle Ben dying in a lot of Spider-Men’s universes.

But a huge chunk of this movie is about how Miles discovers his father is going to die soon, a “canon event,” and he tries to escape Miguel to save his father. What I don’t get is, why is that a canon event? Miguel specifically says Miles wasn’t supposed to be Spider-Man. Kingpin’s collider (in Into the Spider-Verse) which brought the spider to Miles’s universe did that. The collider also killed Miles’s universe’s Peter Parker and created the Spot.

If Miguel is so concerned with “canon,” why didn’t he simply send Spider-People to Miles’s universe before Peter Parker died, save him, and stop the collider? It seems pretty logical to me that if the sole reason for Miles becoming Spider-Man - the collider - wasn’t “supposed to” happen, then Peter’s death and the creation of Spot also wasn’t “supposed to” happen.

Maybe this will be cleared up in the sequel but to me this seems like either a very large hole in the movie’s logic or proof that Miguel is completely wrong about everything. In which case I don’t understand how/why Miguel recruited seemingly thousands of Spider-Men to do his bidding with no actual proof that they’re doing the right thing.",AskScienceFiction,1704595204.0,t3_190hibi,post

Dinotopia is also home to other Mesozoic reptiles such as pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and plesiosaurs, as well as an assortment of Paleozoic and Cenozoic animals.

In particular, one section of Dinotopia-- the Forbidden Mountains-- is inhabited by Ice Age mammals such as mammoths, ground sloths, and saber-toothed cats. From a paleontological perspective, of course, many of these animals are not, strictly speaking, ""prehistoric"" at all, having only gone extinct in the past 12,000 years or so, at a time when modern humans already existed.

[Evangelion] What is the composition of LCL?,"LCL is probably the same as our hypothetical primordial ooze, so what are the elements and compounds within it?  


As every living being on this planet probably has LCL as its basis, then it isn't actually the exact same as the primordial ooze considering that our body has some very complex organs and tissues such as bones and teeth that possesses both carbon-calcium compounds such as calcium carbonate and also our body produces some electrolytes and complex cells such as the nerves that generate electric signals via sodium-potassium pumps.

I want to see what you guys are going to say about it, but considering only humans, I would bet the composition of LCL would most likely be:  
\- Water (universal solvent)  
\- Carbon (the basic element that creates most of the organic ligations)  
\- Oxygen (encountered as a gas and within water)  
\- Hydrogen (encountered within fermentation and bacteria)

"[Fargo, Season 5] Is _______ brain damaged?","I understand Ole Munch to have been hired by Roy to abduct Dot/Lorraine when she popped up in the system following the school board riot. And future episodes show that he is quite crazy and was seemingly descended from a sin-eater. 

But in the first episode, though we don’t see much of his personality, he does not seem as insanely unhinged as he does in the following episodes. Rather, he seems like a Lorne Malvo, Mr. Wrench, or Yuri Gurka type. The traditional shady, underworld hitman/enforcer we’ve seen so many times on this show. He seems to become increasingly unhinged as the season progresses. 

So I am rewatching the season in advance of the finale and it occurs to me, when he and his partner abduct Dot, she shoves an ice skate blade into his head and, later, slams a shovel into his head so hard that he is rendered unconscious. Afterward he becomes progressively irrational and manic.

Is the implication meant to be that Ole Munch suffered a traumatic brain injury in the initial abduction of Dot and the subsequent descent into insanity is a result of the TBI (and likely it going untreated)?

2: mindflayers need to consume brains mainly for their psychic energy and less for physical hormones, proteins etc required for most organisms to stay alive. But how are they able to sustain themselves on psychic energy?

3: how do mindflayers get through the skull of their victim? Their lamprefey-like mouth and certain bodies in baldur's gate 3 imply that they use their teeth to saw it off, but what do they then do with the sawed off part of the skull?",AskScienceFiction,1704456827.0,t3_18z5i9z,post

"[Naruto] [Boruto] Can Baryon Mode Naruto shorten the Life Span of Beings Like Frieza, Scion(From Worm), etc","So while reading about Baryon Mode's abilites, a few thoughts came to my mind.

Naruto's Baryon Mode allows him to have a big jump in speed, strength and reflexes. This form is done when Naruto's and Kurama's chakra are consumed as raw materials,  producing a new type of energy.

But its strongest ability is to reduce the life span of anything that makes contact or is near Naruto.

So can this actually reduce Frieza's life span? Allowing Naruto to hurt frieza long term?

[American Psycho] Why wouldn't Patrick Bateman like new wave music?,"When talking about Huey Lewis & the News, he mentions not being a fan of their pre-Fore albums because they were too new wave for his tastes. From what I know about the 1980's, new wave was one of the most popular forms of music, definitely the most popular form of rock music, in the early-mid 80's. It would have been the quintessential yuppie music along with other forms of popular music during that part of the decade. And seeing as how Bateman is the kind of person that wants to fit into mainstream society at all at costs, why wouldn't he at least pretend to love it? I know the exact year or years the book and film take place in are supposed to be ambiguous due to the main character's insanity driven POV, but I hear a lot of people place somewhere between 1986-1989, maybe even as late as 1991, when the book was published. During this time, new wave was pretty much done for, being replaced by other forms of popular music and being dethroned by hair metal as the most popular form of rock music.

***Kangs travel to each others universes and then a huge war breaks out and the chaos causes universes to crash into each other (aka, Incursions) which endangers the mutliverse.***

You're telling me in the infinite multiverse there aren't multiversal wars between OTHER super-smart scientists and their variants? there's no ***Tony Stark Dynasty?*** no ***Reed Richards Dynasty***? 

Infinite universes=Infinite beings who discover the multiverse and start wars between their infinite variants 

And what about beings and/or organizations who possess the power/tech to facilitate ""Multiversal Travel""? wouldn't there be multiversal wars between them and other beings (not variants, just other people in general) who ALSO have the same tech/power?

Realistically, shouldn't there be an infinite number of multiversal wars between infinite beings/organizations to the point where the Kang Dynasty becomes completely and utterly irrelevant in the grand scheme of things?

[better call saul] How on Earth was Hank’s belly not making noises in S03E01 when he was eating so many nuts?,"Spoilers for season 3 of Better Caul Sall!

When Hank is waiting to see if Gus’ ragtag criminals swap out the tracking device they’ve placed on his car - because Gus wanted to enlist the services of Hank while also keeping an eye on him - Hank is eating so many nuts. An entire bag, in fact.

According to prevention.com, eating ‘too many’ nuts can make someone gassy. What I would like to know is how, if the camera is with him for so long after that, does his stomach not make a burp or gurgle and he never farts? It doesn’t make sense given the context, there’s no plausible plot reason for Hank not behaving like how any of us would behave. He has no noted ability to keep that sort of stuff in, and while he has no anti-feats regarding this, a lack of evidence is not evidence.

She has FULL CONTROL of EVERYTHING within the perimeter of the house. The grass? The trees? The fucking plumbing underground?

[The invincible] Why is Atom Eve so uncreative with her power? It's like she doesn't know how to use them.,"Just because she can't manipulate living beings doesn't mean it's enough. Seriously, being able to manipulate atoms at the molecular level? This alone  makes her too overpower. In battle with Omni-Man, she could have changed the air around him to lava, toxic substances, or super radioactive dust that would essentially choke him(a lot of it). Even with Omni-Man's speed, it wouldn't have been enough; she could have created atoms with huge density that it overwhelmed him or created a nuclear bomb that would explode near him. And so much more..

What about those who rely on technology? They're basically pwerless to her. She could just turn their weapons into sand, and it would be game over. If she had used just one percent of her IQ during her fight with Doc Seismic, she could have turned his tech and clothes into ice and gave him hypothermia.

Instead of using her vastly powerful abilities that could solve nearly all problems — and yes, it won't be perfect, like that one time in season 2, episode — over time, she could learn well, just as she makes her food to eat without harming herself at all because she learned. However, she prefers shooting pink stuff and creating pink shields... This brings me to another question: Why does she like pink so much anyway? Just one color? I've read the comic, and it amazed me that she has never used a color other than pink, not even once.",AskScienceFiction,1704176165.0,t3_18wiib6,post

2) Lack of protection. When it comes to hand to hand combat a helmet is THE most important piece of armour you can have. Take a baseball bat to the chest you might break some ribs, if you're really unlucky maybe even puncture a lung. Take a bar to the head and it's game over.

[Firewatch] Who left the bag with the cave keys for Henry to find? (Plot spoilers),"Very much seems that although Ned was doing much of the sabotage, deception and trickery that he *wasn't* behind the bag with the cave keys being left for Henry to find. 

He writes frantically in his notes that the cave keys have gone missing, and he's clearly panicked that Henry/Delilah will get into the cave and discover Brian. Given that these notes are also found at the very end (well past the point of needing to make Henry/Delilah believe they're wrapped up in a government conspiracy, there's no point for him to do some massive mislead about the cave keys or their role in everything. Henry finding the cave keys is the only thing really keeping the investigation going in the time frame before he leaves in August, and Ned's scheme to pin the fires on Delilah (and Henry as a manipulated sap) would get rid of them regardless.

Now, it seems like if you ignore all that, Ned was the one to place the keys on the bag. I'm pretty sure Ned was the one to put the tripwire alarm behind the bag, alerting him to Henry's return timeframe, giving him enough time to finish up in the lookout tower and flee the scene before Henry can catch him. Ned also seems to have possession of the keys at some point (makes sense how he'd have needed them to get into the cave that Brian ultimately died in), with Delilah only stating another colleague (a female named one from what I recall?) lost them somewhere nearby a while back. You could suggest Ned was using them as bait to lure Henry into the cave and then trap him in there to die, but given how he explored them prior (and the other exits are obvious) and Henry spoke to Delilah on the radio about going there prior to his would-be disappearance, it's likely Henry is found before he dies (and the subsequent rescue uncovers Brian too). So trapping Henry does nothing but delay the inevitable, if anything, guaranteeing it as now Henry is forced into Brian's tomb.

Maybe Ned really did just mess up leaving the keys attached to the bag? Seems like a massive slip-up if so.",AskScienceFiction,1704120508.0,t3_18vy6cf,post

[Marvel and DC] Bruce Wayne and T'Challa’s intelligence,"
Greetings, fellow sci-fi loving Redditors!

I just had a question that I’ve been pondering for a while now. I would greatly appreciate it if you could, kindly, answer it. Black Panther/T’Challa is considered in the Marvel Comics canon as one of the smartest human beings in the Marvel Universe. T'Challa has a PhD in physics from Oxford University and is the ruling monarch of Wakanda. Wakanda is one of the most technologically advanced countries on the Earth of the MU. Bruce Wayne/Batman is considered one of the smartest human beings in the DC Universe. He attended the best colleges in the world and learned from the best scientists and engineers on Earth. He also learned from and trained with the best detectives, martial artists, drivers, marksmen, escape artists, assassins, etc. on the planet. 

I always wondered, of the two heroes, who is more intelligent? 

In which field or fields would T'Challa be more knowledgeable and/or proficient in and in which fields would Bruce have T’Challa beat?

If T'Challa was somehow transported to the DC Universe and was tasked to defeat/outsmart Batman's entire rogues gallery, do you think that T'Challa would be just as capable as Bruce is at outsmarting and/or defeating his enemies? Why or why not?

If Bruce was tasked with defeating and/or outsmarting enemies of Black Panther such as Erik Killmonger and Man-Ape, how would Bruce fare?

Obviously, Bruce Wayne is the world’s greatest detective. How good of a detective is T’Challa? Would he rely more on his technology to solve a mystery or would he use more of his own observance, interpersonal skills, and critical thinking (among other skills) to solve it?

but let's say in this scenario the autobots (or maximals if you want to be time period appropriate) since it would be set in the latter half of the 24th century are in their ark ( Vanguard-class Deep Space Interceptor ) on a deep space mission to look for energon in the delta quadrant/beta quadrant. in this timeline the decepticons never chased after them and they never crashed into earth, they encounter a borg cube like in star trek TNG Q Who.  
  
Let's say the autobot crew consist of the exact crew that optimus prime had in season 1.

"[MCU]If Thanos did a biased mini (20% instead of 50%) snap, what would be the least bad outcome for humanity?","It is established that Thanos’s snap is not biased, as it will kill half the population at random. But if Thanos’s snap was biased and reduced (removing 20% of the population instead of 50%), what would be the least bad outcome for humanity that still fits the requirement of killing 1.6 billion people? 

My ideas
People to spare:
-Those piloting vehicles. It may be plausible to kill the pilot only if there is a copilot 
-Those operating dangerous equipment like a power plant 
-Doctors in the middle of surgery
-Food production supply and logistics 

People to kill:
-Prisoners with no hope of being released 
-Terrorists/organized crime
-Rich socialites (famous for being famous)
-The 2 billion least productive members of society
-Politicians who make things worse

I will not doubt there will be mass misery worldwide from the culling of 20%, but surely one option will bring less mass misery than other options

What size singularity and damage would it cause to have that anywhere close to our system even if it was out of the solar system it would had to have created a gravity well that would affect something.",AskScienceFiction,1703740661.0,t3_18slwyz,post

[Godzilla Minus One] What would’ve happened after the movie from a geopolitical perspective?,"So the movie starts in 1947 with Godzilla attacking US ships and later Tokyo killing hundreds of thousands. The Allied occupation force evacuates Japan when Godzilla first appears and allows Japan to have some of their tanks and ships back and partially remilitarize to fight Godzilla but doesn’t directly get involved for fear of provoking the Soviets (and probably because they didn’t want to waste tons of lives and equipment on a country they just had to fight a war against). Long story short, a bunch of Imperial Japanese veterans quickly reorganize into an impromptu military and manage to defeat Godzilla (he technically isn’t dead but it’s implied they knocked him out pretty hard). What would happen next realistically? Would the allies return to Japan or let them keep their arms as a show of gratitude for saving the world?

My questions are: 

1. Why did Liu (or his editors) choose to make The Hidden Girl the featured story when the overarching plot that connected several of the stories is the singularity and how humanity is inescapably drawn to technology. What connected that story with the overarching theme of the book?

2. Is it possible or alluded to that the hidden girl is just one of the simulated realities the future humans created?

[Marvel] Would martial artists or other soldiers look down on Captain America because of the way he got his powers?,"The famous quote from MCU Iron Man made me wanted to ask this question. The quote go like this, ""everything special about you came out of a bottle"".

There are many badass characters in the Marvel universe who get their powers from training very hard. Whether its the martial artists like Iron Fist and Shang Chi who have master martial arts to the point they can control their Chi energy. Or the more spy ish characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow who trained to get their abilities. I guessed you can put characters like The Punisher or even Batman in the same boat too.

But then again training or having natural powers doesn't necessarily make a character a badass who got their powers like Charles Atlas or One Punch Man. I'm sure Dr. Strange is not considered a badass lol, despite training for magic. And a lot of Mutants like Gambit for example have natural powers that increase their physical stats too.

To believers, the Abrahamic God of Jews, Christians, and Muslims is the most powerful being of all time. He is able to control all of Creation. He sees all that ever was, is, and will be. The Infinity Stones are basically essence of the Universe distilled into powerful stones.

Thanos wanted to gather all the stones to give him the power to >!snap half of all life away as he did in Avengers: Infinity War.

This makes ceramite especially effective at providing protection against directed-energy and particle-based weapons.

Lower-quality ceramite is also used to mass-produce cheap Flak Armour for the Astra Militarum.

An inexpensive and sturdy building material widely used across the Imperium consists of pulp wood formed around a core of low-grade ceramite. This material is used for the construction of the low-cost prefabricated housing blocks prevalent on many Imperial Hive Worlds.",AskScienceFiction,1703514977.0,t3_18qjt5c,post

so let's say in star trek III when kirk and his friends needed to steal the enterprise to save spock.

instead of stealing the enterprise as it was too badly damaged there was a TOS era constitution class ship in space dock part of the mothball fleet oh say... USS New Jersey and it's just sitting there but because of the paperwork mixup the warp drive anti matter pods still has full store of antimatter the ship is fully stocked , locked/loaded ready to go. so lets say scotty installed and modified the main computer to be automatic run with some 2280s tech help.

so kirk steal the TOS era ship and they're on their way

1.) can a TOS era ship interface with the 2280s spacedock controls

2.) let's say they disabled the excelsior transwarp drive anyways they flee will kirk and his friends still know how to operate a TOS era ship

Slade lives again!

...as the only living being in a burnt out hellscape stalked by armies of murderous demons. I give him five minutes.

Slade was clearly fully aware of what Trigon escaping meant and is far from stupid.

You're going to destroy the world, Rave...wait, hang on.*""). And it doesn't seem like Trigon can *compel* obedience after animating him -- he can threaten or promise, but he can't just puppet him.

It seems like Slade remained mostly loyal right up until Trigon set him on fire, but why? What was he expecting to get out of this?

[Star trek]suppose a pre-federation/pre-PD earth ship is thrown across the galaxy by a worm hole and the crew opted to set them selves up as as a ruling class on a pre-warp mediaeval planet. if Starfleet found the planet centuries later would they have the legal right to interfere?,"I feel like there's three episodes that bare on this question:

1)The Masterpiece Society, Ricker says the PD doesn't apply because its a human colony established after the invention of warp. But since because it was also established by humans who lived before the Federation (that's my presumption anyway) the Enterprise crew don't act like they have the right to make them follow Federation law, and try to respect their sovereignty  to a degree

2)False Profits, Voyager encounters some doing some Ferengi doing something like this. Janeway acknowledges its kind of not their business but comes up with a rational to get involved anyway. That kind implies captains have some discretion in situations like this.

3)New Eden, Pike makes it very clear that the Prime directive can apply to humans, especially if they split off from the rest of Earth pre-2063 (not that that would apply in this situation) 

....The 37s arguable contradicts that last one a bit but I imagine Janeway was thinking the fact the people on that planet were the descendants of humans enslaved by warp capable aliens, and they'd reverse engineered some of their tech, applying the PD would be a bit silly",AskScienceFiction,1703010798.0,t3_18m8vrn,post

[Creed] What would have been the impact for Adonis Creed if he had Tommy Gunn as his mentor instead of Rocky Balboa?,"So this is a crazy idea I've wanted to put out for a while now. Now, of course I love the dynamic between Rocky and Adonis. They filled a hole in each other's lives and Adonis was able to progress a lot under Rocky before striking out on his own.  But I wanted to see what you'd guys think of Adonis training under someone who carries the ideals of Rocky but who also had to overcome his inner demons as well- meaning Tommy Gunn. 

Now, of course under the circumstances in canon I don't see this playing out which is why I want to change it up in this new timeline so that it can work. So, let's change it: 

SCENARIO: After Tommy Gunn defeats Union Cane, he has a change of heart from his associations with Duke. When it's time to speak, he gives his credit to Rocky Balboa- the man who took him in. He walks away from Duke's company that same night. He visits Rocky the night of the fight and gives a tearful apology from their fallout. Rocky accepts and Tommy is back in his good graces. 

He enjoys a fruitful career under Rocky's direction. He takes Rocky's family out of the urban neighborhood and becomes a close family friend to them. His last matchup is winning the decision over Mason Dixon before retiring the belt to him. He buys back Mickey's gym and turns it into a place for underprivileged kids to learn the sport of boxing while training contenders. 

When Adonis Creed comes around, he still goes to Rocky to train him. Feeling even more fulfilled this time around, he refuses. But, he tells him to seek out Tommy Gunn in Mick's gym. Adonis does that, meets Tommy, and he takes him on as a student. 

Personally, I believe they'll start out in a much better place. Tommy has nothing to do with Apollo dying so there'd be no tension there. Given Tommy's resentment towards his own father, he can help Adonis with his trauma/anger issues in an angle Rocky couldn't. But I want to know what you guys think.

"[Ringworld/Known Space] If seeing hyper space is so traumatic (the ""Blind Spot"" effect), why are GP Hulls transparent?","I'm reading Ringworld for the first time and while I'm enjoying it, I'm having a hard time reconciling something.

My understanding of how FTL in this universe works (at least what I've understood so far) is ships get shunted into another dimension (or something similar) called ""hyper space"" where they can travel a lot faster than the speed of light. Humans brains aren't wired to work in hyper space- if a window or some other viewport to outside the ship is open, human brains will fill in the space of the window by creating the illusion of stretching the surrounding environment around it, an effect referred to as the ""blind spot."" Apparently seeing these blind spots can be very traumatic and cause people to go insane.

That's a cool idea, and a neat take on FTL, but in the same book they talk about how the hulls of some spaceships are transparent. There's a chapter where they talk about how from the inside of the ship the main cast is in, the only parts of the ship that are visible are some of the interior chambers, conduit running through the ship's walls, door frames, and some other internal infrastructure. The rest of the ship's hull is completely see-through, giving the pilot a really big field of view of space around them.

That's also very cool, but I feel like these two ideas are incompatible. If seeing your surroundings in hyper space would drive you insane, isn't having effectively a giant, 360 degree window to the outside world a really bad idea? I feel like I'm missing something obvious because this is a pretty big contradiction, but all the rest of the science and world building has been very well thought out. I  think I'm probably just misunderstanding something.

Unrelated, but in this same chapter there's a bit where it is described how their destination is ""aft"" of the ship (putting it out of sight of the cockpit because the individual crew chambers have opaque walls, and they're in between the cockpit and the back of the ship) . This would imply the ship is flying backward, but I think that makes sense because they talk about how the ship is decelerating really rapidly. I guess to slow down the ship has spun around to face its engines toward their destination, so they can fire them and push against the inertia from leaving hyperspace?",AskScienceFiction,1702881267.0,t3_18l29mi,post

[star trek] how do starfleet promote officers to the admiralty?,I always wondered about this for example we see starfleet admiral characters in star trek that rank up from captain.

Or picard as 4 star admiral in Picard or he was already mentioned as admiral in lower decks.  Or Kirk as rear admiral in the motion picture. Or offscreen archer became 4 star admiral (chief of staff) So we know in the us army in order to make it to the flag ranks you have to attend the army war college and command and general staff school just to not only get your foot in the door but to even get promoted beyond an army major.

[Invincible] How was the Coalition of Planets able to survive?,"So, if I am understanding the lore of Invincible correctly. Thaddeus killed Argall and due to the Viltrumite Empire being what I assume is an absolute monarchy fueled by a strong ""might-makes right"" philosphy, Argall's death caused a power vaccum, which in turn caused a civil war that was worsened by the Scourge Virus. The instability that Viltrum experienced at this time caused the Empire to experience a partial collapse in which several conquered worlds took advantage of the weakened Viltrumite Empire to join Thaddeus's Coalition.  

My question is, once the Viltrumite Empire was rebuilt under Thragg's leadership. What exactly stopped it from completely wiping out the Coalition with relative ease? Omniman was able to destroy the entire Flaxan Civilization within less than an hour, why couldn't the Viltrumites just send Nolan or someone similar to obliterate Talescria and the Coalition's member worlds?

**1)** Would you be able to see Thestrals if you watched, say, a real recording of someone being violently executed? Say you watch them beg for mercy, and say this the first time you see someone actually dying for real, since movies and videogames don't really count; movie and videogames deaths are way too different from the real thing.

**2)** Would you be able to see Thestrals if you watched and came to terms with a beloved pet dying in front of your eyes, a pet that you love with all your heart?

**3)** Would someone who lacks any kind of empathy be able to see Thestrals, someone who could kill countless people with their own hands and no feel any kind or remorse, someone who could even forget all about the person they killed because the act is so unimportant to them?

If respawning is to be expected upon being turned into coins, then why did everyone believe he died for good at the funeral? Why did he even have a funeral. Sure, Romona figured out he was kidnapped because of her dreams, but why did everyone else even consider death a possibility?

I guess you could say that Gideon bought the other exes extra lives when he formed the league, but that doesn't seem to be the case either. Scott's extra life brought him back in time before his fight with Gideon. Obviously none of the evil exes did that upon respawning, so presumably they just hit ""Continue"".

The DMA measured five light years in diameter and exhibited a gravity well and gravitational distortions consistent with a wormhole.

Say another person she makes a deal with wants to be a prosecutor that can’t lose a single case and goes after the ushers. or another business person makes a deal with Verna and then  competes with the ushers. This would directly conflict with verna’s deal because she is offering to contradictory plans to each group.  Only one can come out on top.

I've been making many friends in Slytherin and realizing that I don't have that much in common with the folks in Ravenclaw. I don't know if it's that I've changed, or I was sorted into the wrong place, or what, but I wonder if someone knows the process of transfering Houses.

Yet Billy Batson as Captain Marvel, and in his entirety, is way more than a child. He's obviously a special case, where as the laws are made to keep a general majority safe. I understood not being able to enjoy their life publicly together, but their would be no need to divulge the level of their relationship when out, and they ofc could keep their intimacy a secret for like (5?) more years.  
  
Seems to me like an unwise decision

Then if you want to argue, they had to break it off for what they represent. I'd argue, their personal lives should not factor into that. For one society doesn't know Cap Marvel is a kid, and for two they can keep their PDA to a minimum in the greater public.

starfleet decide to send a full battle group and sends 2 excelsiors, 2 mirandas, VOY (battle group lead ship), 2 akira class, 2 nebula class to hunt down the maquis in the badlands and recover tuvok.  
  
so they all get swept to the delta quadrant. same situation they recover the maquis chakotay others and absorb them in the VOY crew (as civilians or crewman) let's say for whatever reason the caretaker array self destructs and the battle group are stranded in the delta quadrant. let's say all other ships decided that VOY and janeway are in total command as she was mission commander picked by starfleet anyways. so they all trek home.

[Dune] Are present rates of spice harvesting sustainable?,"As an apprentice Planetologist, I have been trained to be wary of practices that damage a planet's ecology.  Specifically, I am worried about unsustainable harvesting of the following commodities for export: 

*  Elacca wood on Ecaz

*  Spice on Arrakis

*  Murderous psychopaths on Tleilax

In the case of Arrakis, perhaps the most valuable ecosystem in the Known Universe, we harvest thousands of tons of *melange* every year, taking it out of the ecosystem.  What will happen if this is not properly regulated?  What native Arakeen creatures depend on the spice for their own lifestyles?

[lotr] [wow] [various other fantasy story's] why are goblin's seen as inferior by most fantasy races,"  
in most fantasy settings goblin's are seen as inferior stupid vermin. to the point that the elimination of an entire settlement is seen as no different then exterminating an infestation of cockroaches. most writers when including goblins will write the individuals as stupid as believable for the world. yet in most of these settings goblins tend to use very advanced weapons bombs and artillery albeit of questionable quality.  
tolkien the inventor of the modern fantasy goblin once gave this description: ""they made no beautiful things, but many clever ones including machines, tools, weapons, and instruments of torture. They were delighted by wheels, engines, and explosions, and could tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled Dwarves"" this imply's the use of mechanized construction and mining. although the groups bilbo and frodo encountered never used scientifically based weapons or mechanized attack vehicles they probably did have the ability the make them with the only reason they dident being the personal preference of there individual leaders at the time. in world of war craft goblin's tend to be trash mobs and yet they are the inventors of mech technology in the medieval set swords and sorcery world.  
by all acounts given the Medieval era tech they have to work, with goblins are scientifically minded geniuses and inspite of there war mongering are less racist then there cousins the elves as they harber no actual hatred towards the other races only attacking them because thats what they were made to do. where as elves the most op race ever in addition to being racists that view everyone as inferior to them, inspite of there supposedly high intelects tend to use the same tech as everyone else swords bows etc albeit of a tremendously high quality level and backed by magic but still the same Medieval tech you'd expect from the era. in the real life middle ages although a race like the goblins would likly still be feared and persecuted likly they would have still been hailed as great geniuses with there creations being highly sought after. so what gives why would fantasy races belittle these genius's intellects and treat them as vermain

[Super Mario Bros] Why is the princess almost always in another castle?,"Could Mario feasibly have approached the correct castle first and not wasted his time and energy fighting through seven other territories in order to encounter a decoy of his enemy and a disappointing message?

&#x200B;

Presumably he didn't know Peach would *not* be in each castle, or he wouldn't have to be told each time  (apologetically?) by Toad. Each realisation that Peach isn't there feels like a disappointment rather than an inevitability. We get the impression, I think, that Mario wasn't expecting it every single time.

&#x200B;

Could he have chosen a different route through the Kingdom and reached Bowser's Castle earlier, or is it necessary that he navigates through different regions to reach his enemy's fortress, like Frodo journeying through various realms of Mordor to reach Mount Doom? 

&#x200B;

Or was Mario intending to free the Retainer Toads each time? Was he nobly working through each castle one by one, rescuing the Princess's loyal servants before he turned his attention to the primary hostage? (Wouldn't it have been more strategic to destroy Bowser and free the Princess, then go about the business of freeing her retainers?)

&#x200B;

Is it possible that Mario needs to free the retainers in order to get instructions to finding Peach? If so, why doesn't the first retainer send him directly to the correct castle? Are the retainers actually prioritising the freedom of all their mushroom servant friends, and sending him to the other, lesser castles first, rather than directing him immediately to Bowser and Peach?

&#x200B;

Is the Kingdom two-dimensional with only one linear path to the final castle, or could it have been reached more directly? (Or is it at the centre of a Kingdom of concentric territories, so it's always going to be the furthest and hardest to reach?)

&#x200B;

And as an additional question, was Bowser's Castle in *Super Mario Bros* originally Peach's Castle, conquered and usurped by the Koopa King? (*Super Mario Bros.: Peach-hime Kyūshutsu Dai Sakusen!* seems to suggest this)

Why is a future with time travel such a bad thing that you'd willing go back in time to kill your friends, lovers and yourself. It can't really just be ""now we can know all of history so it's just a bit booring"" can it?

The way I interpret time travel in this context is that when you travel you just affect your own personal timeline while leaving the ""master"" line unchanged, I believe this because there have been no previous episodes involving time travel in a major way, future Jason exists so that means there aren't people going back every day to destroy the human race and change history on a grand scheme.

[Black Panther] How smart is T’Challa really?,"
Hi sci-fi fans of Reddit!
I had a question that has been bugging me for a while now. How smart is T’Challa? I’m specifically referring to T’Challa in the main Marvel Comics Earth-616 continuity. I know that T’Challa has a PhD in physics from Oxford University and has access to some of  the best technology on the Earth of the Marvel Universe and to the nearly indestructible metal known as Vibranium
through the country of Wakanda. However, what are some of T’Challa’s greatest feats of scientific and technological prowess? Could you guys, kindly, list some of them? How good of a detective is T’Challa? If there was a mystery and a handful of the best detectives in comics and fiction in general (i.e. Sherlock Holmes, Misty Knight, Bruce Wayne, Jessica Jones, and Charles Victor Szasz/Victor ""Vic"" Sage/The Question) were also tasked with solving it, how quickly would T’Challa solve the mystery? 

Thank you, guys! Really appreciate your input! Have a great one, fellow Redditors!

However aside from dominion over the galaxy it seems a bit unclear what precisely the Empire is hoping to change politically about the way the Galaxy is run.

The Empire and First Order don't seem particularly to care about diminishing conflicts or reducing crime because the Hutt's and many piracy groups seem to thrive equally well regardless of era.

They don't seem particularly concerned with ending slavery or illegal trading of any kind. Both seem to be alive and well irrespective of whoever is in charge.

There doesn't seem to be any concerted effort to improve relationships with the outer ring of systems or ensure trade and supplies go to civilizations that need it or really anything to improve the quality of life for people in the galaxy. They don't even pay lip service to attempt to claim such things

In fact it seems the only thing the Empire and First Order both seem to be tremendously preoccupied with is killing Jedi and force sensitive people.

[MCU] Who is objectively the best hand to hand fighter?,"Before anyone asks this isn't about who would win in a fight between A or B that's not the question I'm asking here nor am i asking which character is physically the strongest. But if the mods think this post breaks the rules feel free to remove it.

I'm trying to determine pound for pound who are the best fighters in terms of ability for their weight class and ability level. We understand pretty definitively which Avengers are physically the fastest, mot powerful, smartest etc but never seem to get a clear answer on the best fighter.

In this debate in my opinion people with unaltered abilities or more conventional weapons should rank a bit higher than people with enhancements, supernatural power boosts, rely primarily on high tech weaponry or aren't human to begin with.

For example most people might say Captain America or Shang Chi might be near the top but Cap both has the added advantages of the Super Soldier Serum and a Vibranium shield. Shang Chi is a high level expertly skilled fighter but he now clearly has the added advantage of the 10 rings. Thor is Asgardian so he automatically has a tremendous strength boost etc etc.

If i had to pick based on these criteria i would probably say Nat and Okoye are the top two with Okoye coming out on top as THE most skilled fighter on earth. Natasha seems to have some manner of modest enhancement of some kind and uses widow based weaponry. Okoye like all the Dora Milaje seem to only rely primarily on basic spears, albeit Vibranium spears but they seem to work the same way as any conventional spear would. Adding to this Okoye was superbly able to hold her own against several Talokanil with superhuman strength, speed and regenerative abilities for an extended period of time until she was blown off the bridge.

[Harry Potter] Limits of Unplottable Places against determined Muggles,"Unplottability is given a few examples (Hogwarts, 12 Grimmauld Place) and several layers of protection:

-If Muggles do get close, it's disguised (appearing as ruins)

-If Muggles try and approach, they're charmed into disregarding the idea (ie, remembering something urgent at home)

[STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT] Would the crew of the Enterprise E launched a mutiny against Captain Picard if Lilly did not intervene?,"In the movie, Star Trek: First Contact, the Borg assimilated decks and advancing towards the bridge. The crew realised their weapons are ineffective against the Borg, which Captain Picard ordered them to stand their ground and even fight hand-to-hand if necessary. However, the majority of the crew, including Worf and Crusher prefered to evacuate on escape pods and set the ship on self-destruct to destroy the Borg. Picard rejected this plan and Lilly decided to confront them to change his mind. 

 Would the Enterprise crew launched a mutiny if Lilly did not intervene? I can imagine Worf or Crusher leading this, especially Worf believes Picard's experience with the Borg is affecting his judgement and the crew about to lose control of the bridge.

[Nightmare On Elm Street] Why they don't arrest Freddy when they pull him into the realm of the living?,"In almost all parts of Nightmare On Elm Street survivors manage to pull Freddy into the real world and kill him. Which is counter productive when you realize he just goes back into the nightmare realm and recharges and goes back to same old.

Which begs the question. Why don't survivors make a plan where they pull him out, tie him up and call the police? 

I am sure it would raise the questions about paranormal but knowing the police they would just look at the case as a serial killer went into hiding and was captured by survivors after coming out from hiding decades later.

Not only would he not be able to haunt dreams again (at least for a long time) but he would stay in human form until his physical body dies of old age. And by that time I'm sure having him as a prime example of paranormal scientists would find a way to combat paranormal somehow.",AskScienceFiction,1706159210.0,t3_19f1lbo,post
[Pokemon] How would a deaf trainer give orders to their pokemon in combat?,"Given that pokemon move through the battlefield a lot when they're battling, hearing orders from their trainer from any direction is very practical. 

But what if a trainer was deaf, or couldn't speak? How would they give orders to their pokemon in battle? I can imagine that giving orders via sign language can be a disadvantage since the pokemon in questiom has to look at the trainer instead of the other pokemon. 

Maybe they have a device that works like in Pokken Tournament? Something that instantly transmits orders mentally and lets the pokemon just throw move after move in combos? But that sounds very broken and unfair. 

Now that I think about it, have they ever addressed the existance of trainers with sensorial disabilities in the anime? I've never seen a blind trainer, for example.",AskScienceFiction,1706158794.0,t3_19f1gkv,post
